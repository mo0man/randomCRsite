# Memory

      1. A MEMORY UNIT (MU) is a space available to the Runner to install programs. Memory units always appear with a quantity, such as 2\[MU\], which means “2 memory units.”
      1. The Runner’s MEMORY LIMIT is the total number of memory units the Runner has. **If the Runner’s identity card does not specify a starting memory limit,** their starting memory limit is 4\[MU\]. Card abilities that indicate +\[MU\] apply that increase to the Runner’s memory limit.

*Example: The Runner has Astrolabe installed, which has the ability “+1\[MU\]”. The Runner can therefore have up to 5\[MU\] worth of programs installed.*

      1. Programs have a MEMORY COST that is continually applied against the memory limit.

R ule 3.9.3 details how the Runner’s installed programs are constrained by the memory

limit.
