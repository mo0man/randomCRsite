      1. In the ENCOUNTER ICE PHASE#8202;**,** the Runner can interact with a piece of ice and the ice’s subroutines can resolve.
      1. To ENCOUNTER a piece of ice is to resolve an Encounter Ice Phase for that ice.

         1. If an ability directs the Runner to encounter a piece of ice, resolve an Encounter Ice Phase but do not change the Runner’s position, if any. After the encounter, return to the effect that caused the encounter and proceed from there. This type of encounter outside the normal progression of a run is referred to as a FORCED ENCOUNTER.

*Example: If Shiro causes Chrysalis to be accessed, resolve the encounter with Chrysalis and then return to resolving subroutines on Shiro.*

         1. If a forced encounter occurs during a run, an instruction to end the run during that encounter is applied to both the encounter ice phase being resolved and the phase from which the additional encounter was initiated. If a forced encounter occurs outside of a run, an instruction to end the run simply aborts the encounter ice phase and returns the game to the effect that called for the encounter.

*Example: The Twins forces the Runner to encounter a piece of ice again while they are passing it. If a subroutine directs the Corp to end the run during the extra encounter, both that encounter and the original Pass Ice phase are aborted, and the game proceeds to the Run Ends phase.*

         1. Note that being directed to encounter a piece of ice is not analogous to being directed to approach a piece of ice.
