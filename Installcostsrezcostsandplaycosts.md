# Install costs, rez costs, and play costs are all costs that are inherent properties of cards. These costs are automatically applied to any ability that performs the corresponding actions (installing, rezzing, or playing) unless that ability stipulates oth

         1. **When a player takes an action that plays or installs one or more cards and has no other effects, the play cost or install cost of each of those cards is considered to have been spent to take that action, even though other steps take place between initiating the action and paying that cost.**

***Example: The Corp has Jeeves Model Bioroids rezzed, and uses the basic action "\[Click\]: Play an operation." to play Blue Level Clearance. Both the click spent for the cost of the basic action and the click spent for Blue Level Clearance's additional cost count as clicks spent to take the "\[Click\]: Play an operation." action.***

      1. The INSTALL COST of a card must be paid to install that card.

      1. &nbsp;
         1. The install cost of a program, resource, or piece of hardware is listed on the card itself.
         1. The install cost of a piece of ice is a number of credits equal to the number of pieces of ice already protecting the server that ice will be installed protecting.
         1. There is no cost to install an asset, upgrade, or agenda.

&nbsp;

      1. The PLAY COST of an operation or event must be paid to play that card. It is listed on the card itself.
      1. The REZ COST of an asset, upgrade, or piece of ice must be paid in order to rez that card. It is listed on the card itself.
      1. The TRIGGER COST of each paid ability is the first part of that ability’s text. It is followed by a colon (:) and then the ability’s effect. See section 9.5 for more details on paid abilities.
      1. An ADDITIONAL COST adds something to the regular cost of initiating a particular game effect. A player must pay all additional costs along with any regular costs in order to initiate an effect.
         1. If a player would be forced to carry out a game effect, but doing so has an additional cost, that player may decline to pay the additional cost, even if they are able to pay it, thus preventing that effect from occurring.

*Example: The Runner accesses an Obokata Protocol. Normally the Runner is forced to steal agendas that they access, but because Obokata Protocol has an additional cost to steal, the Runner can decline to suffer the net damage and not steal the agenda.*

      1. &nbsp;
         1. A player must pay all additional costs simultaneously with the cost that is being added to, even if multiple cards or abilities are adding separate additional costs. A player cannot pay the original cost or any of the additional costs individually. If they cannot pay for all of the costs at once, then they do not pay any of the costs and the corresponding effects cannot occur.

*Example: The Runner accesses an Obokata Protocol while Ben Musashi and Predictive Algorithm are both active. The Runner must be able to pay 2 credits and suffer 6 net damage all at once in order to steal the Obokata Protocol, even though each of the three costs are from different card abilities. After all costs have been paid, abilities that meet their trigger conditions from the paying of any of those costs, such as I’ve Had Worse or Order of Sol, can then resolve as applicable.*

   1. &nbsp;
      1. A NESTED COST is a cost appearing within an ability’s **instructions** that must be paid while the ability is resolving in order for some or all of the rest of the effects of that ability to resolve.
         1. Nested costs are usually written in the format “\[player\] may \[cost\] to \[**instructions**\]”

**or “you may \[cost\]. If you do, \[instructions\]**.” If the indicated player pays the

&nbsp;

indicated cost, the indicated **instructions are resolved**. Otherwise, that part of the ability is not **resolved**.

      1. &nbsp;
         1. Nested costs can also be written in the format “\[**instructions**\] unless \[player\] \[cost\].” If the indicated player pays the indicated cost, the indicated **instructions are not resolved**. Otherwise, that **instruction is resolved**.

*Example: A subroutine reading “End the run unless the Runner pays 1\[c\].” contains a nested cost. If the Runner chooses to pay 1\[c\], the subroutine will not end the run.*
