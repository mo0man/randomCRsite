# Credits

*Each of the Runner’s credits represents enough money to upgrade some basic parts for their console, have a meal at a decent restaurant, or buy a ticket and some concessions for a night at the sensies.*

*Each of the Corp’s credits represents enough money to manufacture a run of computer parts, buy out a decent restaurant, or film a low-budget sensie.*

      1. A CREDIT (\[c\]) is the basic unit of currency. Players spend their credits to pay for various costs, card abilities, traces, etc. Credit tokens most commonly represent 1\[c\] each, but can represent larger denominations if clearly marked.
      1. Each player has a CREDIT POOL where they keep a supply of credit tokens matching the credits they have available to spend. The number of credits in a player’s credit pool is open information.

      1. Credits enter and leave a player’s credit pool as that player gains, spends, or loses credits.
         1. A player GAINS credits whenever credits enter their credit pool from any location.

         1. If a player is instructed to LOSE credits, that player is forced to move the specified number of credits from their credit pool to the bank. Players cannot lose credits from cards.

*Example: If a subroutine on DNA Tracker resolves, the Runner must lose 2\[c\] from their credit pool, or 1\[c\] if that is all they have. If the Runner’s credit pool is empty, the effect does nothing.*

         1. If a player is instructed to SPEND or PAY credits, that player must put the specified number of credits back into the bank. The credits spent can come from the credit pool or from a card that player controls with an ability allowing credits on it to be spent for the type of ability being resolved. **The terms “spend” and “pay” are synonymous.**

*Example: The Runner may use the credit from Cyberfeeder to pay for Atman’s first ability.*

*Example: The Runner may use credits from Ghost Runner when secretly spending credits to resolve a Psi ability (such as The Future Perfect).*

*Example: The Runner must use credits from Ghost Runner if this is the only way for them to pay 3\[c\] when resolving the “when encountered” ability on Tollbooth.*

      1. Abilities can place credits on cards, **as discussed in section 1.12**. Credits on a player’s card are not in that player’s credit pool; the player can only interact with those credits as instructed by card abilities.
         1. If a player is instructed to TAKE credits from a card, they remove that many credits from that card and gain those credits.
         1. If an ability specifies how a player is allowed to spend credits from a card, they can be spent from that card as if they were in the player’s credit pool for the specified actions or abilities.
         1. If an ability specifies a time period during which a player is allowed to spend credits from a card, they can be spent from that card as if they were in the player’s credit pool for any purpose (other than losing credits) as long as the specified time period is active or the specified duration has not expired.
         1. Spending credits from a card is considered “using” the card **that allowed those credits to be spent**. **See section 9.1.6**.
