# Position

      1. The Runner’s POSITION during a run is a measure of their distance from the server. The Runner’s possible positions correspond to the positions of ice protecting the attacked server.
         1. The Runner does not have a position while they are not engaged in a run, nor do they maintain their position from one run to the next. The Runner always begins a run in the outermost position.
      1. The Runner progresses through the positions protecting a server (and corresponding ice) in order. They approach, encounter (if the ice is rezzed), and pass each piece of ice, then proceed to the next piece of ice moving inward, until they pass the innermost piece of ice or the run is ended.
      1. Ice entering or leaving a position protecting the attacked server server can affect the Runner’s position.
         1. If a piece of ice is added to or removed from the attacked server in a position outward from the Runner’s current position, nothing happens. The Runner will normally not need to approach or encounter the new piece of ice to reach the server.

*Example: During a run on R\&D, Architect fires and the Corp installs a new piece of ice in the outermost position protecting this server. The Runner does not approach that new piece of ice during this run because they have already passed that position.*

         1. If a piece of ice is added to the attacked server in a position inward from the Runner’s current position, the Runner and each piece of ice outside of the new ice’s position shift one space outward.

*Example: During a run on a remote server, Howler fires and the Corp installs a new piece of ice in the next inward position protecting the server. The Runner will have to approach that new piece of ice later in this run because they have not passed that position.*

         1. If a piece of ice inward from the Runner’s position is uninstalled or moved to another server, the Runner and each piece of ice outside of the departed ice’s

&nbsp;

position shift one space inward. The Runner does not re-approach ice they have already passed.

      1. Changes to the piece of ice in the Runner’s current position can affect the progression of the run, but they do so differently during the Approach Ice Phase than during the Encounter Ice Phase.
         1. If a piece of ice is uninstalled or moved to another position (protecting this or another server) while it is being approached, the Runner moves to the Pass Ice Phase, all outward ice moves one position inward, and the run continues. The Runner does not re-approach ice they have already passed.

*Example: The Runner has passed two ice, and is approaching the innermost piece of ice which is a rezzed Himitsu-Bako. During the paid ability window of the approach, the Corp uses the ability on Himitsu-Bako to put it into HQ. All remaining ice on the server moves one position closer, and the Runner is now passing the innermost position and is about to approach the server.*

         1. If a piece of ice is uninstalled or derezzed while it is being encountered, the Runner moves to the Pass Ice Phase. All outward ice moves one position inward if the ice was uninstalled, and the run continues. The Runner does not re-approach ice they have already passed.
         1. If a piece of ice currently being encountered moves to another position or is swapped with installed ice in another position, the Runner remains with the encountered ice and continues the run from that ice’s new position.

*Example: The Runner encounters Bullfrog as the innermost piece of ice protecting a remote server. Bullfrog’s subroutine resolves and it is moved to be the outermost piece of ice protecting Archives. The Runner is now running on Archives and continues the run from Bullfrog’s new position.*

      1. &nbsp;
         1. If a piece of ice currently being approached is swapped with ice in another position, the Runner remains in their current position and is now approaching the new piece of ice occupying that position.
         1. If a piece of ice is uninstalled, derezzed, moved, or swapped while it is being passed, the Runner is not moved and is still passing the original position.
