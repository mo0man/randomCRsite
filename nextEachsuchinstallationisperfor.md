# next. Each such installation is performed as a separate instruction. See rule 9  .10.4b.

*Example: The Runner uses Mass Install to install three programs. The Runner can install Dhegdheer first, and then host one of the other two programs on Dhegdheer in order to reduce the install cost.*

      1. As part of the installation process, a player installing an agenda, asset, upgrade, ice, or program has the opportunity to trash like cards.
         1. When installing an agenda, asset, or upgrade in a remote server, the Corp may first trash any other cards already installed in that server. If the card to be installed is an asset or agenda, the Corp must trash any other asset or agenda from that server. If the card to be installed is a **region**, the Corp must trash any other **region** from that server.
         1. When installing an upgrade in the root of a central server, the Corp may first trash any other upgrades already installed in that root. If the card to be installed is a **region**, the Corp must trash any other **region** from that root.
         1. When installing ice protecting a server, the Corp may first trash any other ice already installed protecting that server. Ice trashed in this way will not be counted when determining the install cost of the new ice.
         1. When installing a program, the Runner may first trash any number of programs already installed. They must do so if installing the new program would exceed their memory limit.
      1. If the Corp trashes any cards during the installation process, the trashed cards are placed in Archives with the same faceup or facedown status they had while installed.
      1. If the last card installed in or protecting a remote server is uninstalled outside of the installation process, then the server ceases to exist during the next checkpoint. See s ection 10.3.
      1. The Corp cannot destroy a server by installing cards. While the Corp is installing a card in a remote server, that server does not cease to exist during any checkpoints that occur before the install effect is complete. Even if the last card installed in or protecting a remote server is trashed during the installation process, it is still considered the same server after the new card has been installed.
      1. If a piece of ice is uninstalled while being approached or encountered, any open paid ability window is completed. Then the approach or encounter ends without completing any further steps of that timing structure. The Runner passes the position the uninstalled ice had occupied, and the run continues.
      1. Whenever a card is uninstalled, there is no memory of its previous state, and it is considered to be a new copy of the card.

      1. Some types of cards have an install cost, which must be paid before the card can become installed, unless an ability indicates that this cost should be ignored.
         1. The install cost of a piece of ice is one credit for each piece of ice already installed protecting the destination server at the time the cost is to be paid. The install cost of a piece of hardware, program, or resource is indicated on the card. Assets, agendas, upgrades, and facedown Runner cards have no install cost. See also

s ection 1.15.5.

         1. If a card has an install cost of X, the value for X is chosen by the player at the time the cost would normally be paid, according to any stipulations indicated in the cardâ€™s text box. This value of X is maintained until the install effect is complete.
         1. After the install cost is paid, a checkpoint occurs, as required by rule 10.3.4.
