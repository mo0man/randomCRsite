      1. The PLAY AREA is the shared active zone into which cards are played or installed. The play area normally starts the game empty except for each of the player’s identities.

      1. The number of cards in the play area and where in the play area they are located is always open information.
      1. Whether or not a card itself and its attributes are open information while in the play area is determined by the card’s status. Cards that are faceup are open information and can be examined by any player at any time. Cards that are facedown are secret information and can only be examined by the player who controls the card. See section 10.2.
      1. Whether or not a card is active while in the play area is determined by the card’s status.

         1. Generally, Corp agendas, assets, ice, and upgrades are installed into the play area unrezzed and thus inactive. They are active while rezzed. See section 8.2.
         1. Generally, Runner hardware, programs, and resources are installed into the play area faceup and active. See section 8.2.
         1. Some Runner cards are installed facedown or turned facedown through card abilities. This is distinct from the status of rezzed/unrezzed that Corp cards can have. Facedown Runner cards are not active. See s ection 8.4.
         1. Operations and events are played into the play area faceup and are active for the duration of their resolution before being trashed. See section 8.5.
      1. Some cards in the play area are organized into specific orientations and/or locations.

         1. Corp cards are arranged into distinct servers. Agendas and assets are installed in remote servers, upgrades are installed in remote servers or in roots of central servers, and ice are installed horizontally protecting servers. See section 4.7.6.
         1. The Corp’s identity is used to indicate where in the play area HQ exists for the purposes of installing upgrades in the root of HQ and ice protecting HQ. See

s ection 4.7.7.

         1. The Runner’s identity, hardware, programs, and resources do not have specific locations in the play area.

      1. &nbsp;
         1. There is no specific location in the play area for operations or events. They are simply played into the play area, where they resolve before being trashed. See s&nbsp; ection 8.5.
         1. Some cards can act as install locations for other cards while in the play area, such that cards of a specific type can be hosted directly onto them during the installation process. In this type of host relationship, both the host card and the hosted card are in the play area, but the host relationship can affect certain aspects of either the card or the installation process. See section 1.12.
         1. Some cards can host other cards without installing them. In this type of host relationship, both the host card and the hosted card are in the play area, but the hosted card is not installed and thus not active. See s ection 1.12.
