         1. RECURRING CREDITS (\[recurring\]) place credits on a card repeatedly. The text “N\[recurring\]” means “Before this card becomes active or your turn begins, if there are fewer than N credits on it, place credits on this card until there are N credits on it.”
         1. Recurring credits do not accumulate. They are refilled only up to the indicated number.
         1. Recurring credits are refilled during step 5.6.1c of the Corp’s turn and s tep 5.7.1c of the Runner’s turn, before other abilities that **apply** at the start of the turn resolve.

*Example: The Runner installs Spinal Modem, which has 2\[recurring\]. 2 credits are placed on Spinal Modem now. The Runner spends 1 of those credits later in their turn. At the beginning of the Runner’s next turn, the credits on Spinal Modem should be replenished up to 2\[c\], so 1 more credit is placed on it.*
