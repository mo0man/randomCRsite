         1. OPEN INFORMATION is any information about the game, game state, cards, or abilities that is available to both players. This includes faceup cards in Archives and the heap, the number of cards in HQ, R\&D, the stack, and the grip, the number of credits in a credit pool, and any other information continuously available to both players.
         1. Open information cannot be hidden from an opponent. A player must allow their opponent to discover the information themselves if they attempt to do so.

*Example: The Runner installs Femme Fatale, choosing a piece of ice protecting HQ with Femme’s ability. The Runner must explicitly state to the Corp which ice has been chosen and must continue to do so if the Corp asks for Femme Fatale’s target during a later turn.*
