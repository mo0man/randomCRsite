      1. A card’s influence cost, or influence value, is represented in a bar with 5 circular slots near the bottom of most cards. The influence cost is the number of slots that are filled with a blue circle, and can range from 0 to 5.
      1. Some cards cannot be played out of faction, and therefore do not have an influence value, which is different from an influence cost of “0”. These cards do not have the influence bar at all.
      1. Some Corp cards have the subtype **alliance** and text defining adjustments to their influence costs. The ability adjusting the influence cost of an **alliance** card applies only when determining the legality of an already constructed deck and does not have any effect during gameplay. The ability references other cards included in the deck to determine whether the card should apply its printed influence cost or 0 against the deck’s influence limit.
