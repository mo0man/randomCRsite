         1. HIDDEN INFORMATION is any information about the game, game state, or cards unavailable to one or more players. This includes facedown cards in play or in Archives, cards in HQ or R\&D, cards in the Runnerâ€™s grip or stack, etc.
         1. A player cannot learn hidden information without the aid of a game effect, rule, or another player verbally communicating the information. However, if a player that has access to information about the game or a card chooses to verbally share it with their opponent, that player is not required to tell the truth. Bluffing is allowed.

*Example: The Runner uses Indexing. While rearranging cards, the Runner places Braintrust on top of R\&D, followed by Snare\!. The Corp draws at the beginning of their next turn, then spends their first click to draw a card. For their second click, the Corp installs a card in an empty remote server, telling the Runner that they should run it because it is a Braintrust.*
