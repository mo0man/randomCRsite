# Paid abilities on an icebreaker that modify that icebreaker’s strength implicitly have a duration of “for the remainder of the current encounter”.

***Example: Corroder has the ability “1\[c\]: +1 strength.” Since no duration is specified, this strength increase applies until the end of the current encounter.***

         1. **If an icebreaker’s paid ability specifies another duration for modifying its strength, that modification lasts until both the stated duration and the implicit encounter duration have expired.**

***Example: Gordian Blade has the ability “1\[c\]: +1 strength for the remainder of this run.” This ability applies until the end of the current run, whether it is triggered during an encounter or another step of the run. If the ability is triggered during an encounter that takes place outside of a run, the strength increase applies for the duration of that encounter.***

         1. **If an icebreaker’s paid ability modifies its strength outside of an encounter and does not specify another applicable duration, the modification expires during the next checkpoint.**

***Example: If the Runner uses Corroder’s ability to increase its strength outside of an encounter, it applies only until the next checkpoint.***

         1. All icebreakers have abilities that can interact with ice. The most common interaction is to break one or more subroutines, but some icebreakers can interact by reducing the strength of ice or derezzing ice.
         1. The Runner can only use an ability on an icebreaker that would interact with a piece of ice during an encounter with that piece of ice. Abilities that interact with ice cannot be used outside step 6.9.3b of the encounter timing structure. If an encounter skips step 6.9.3b or ends before step 6.9.3b is reached, then no subroutines on the ice are broken.
         1. The Runner can only use an ability on an icebreaker that would interact with a piece of ice if the icebreaker has strength greater than or equal to the strength of the ice. An icebreaker’s strength is only relevant when using abilities on that icebreaker to interact with ice.
         1. If an ability on an icebreaker specifies that it affects a particular subtype of ice, then that ability can only be used on a piece of ice that has the specified subtype. If an

&nbsp;

ability on an icebreaker does not specify a subtype of ice that it affects, that ability can be used on any piece of ice.
