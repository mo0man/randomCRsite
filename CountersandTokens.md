      1. COUNTERS and TOKENS are game pieces (or equivalent) that track various resources, effects, and statuses of players and their cards.
         1. The terms “counter” and “token” are interchangeable.

      1. The BANK is the supply of tokens not yet in play. Tokens in the bank are available to both players to take and use as dictated by the game rules and card abilities. Players do not control tokens in the bank and cannot spend them. The bank is an unlimited supply; running out of game pieces to track a type of token does not prohibit a player from **gaining tokens of that type or placing them on cards**.
      1. Some abilities can convert a card into a counter. A counter put into play in this way is tracked **with** the card **acting** as a game piece. See rule 10.1.4.
      1. Some abilities can cause a player or card to have or be “considered to have” one or more tokens or additional tokens without placing or giving those tokens. A token considered to exist in this way conveys all the same information and effects as a token of the specified type would, except that it cannot be moved or removed from the card or player it belongs to, nor can it be spent to pay a cost.
      1. There are ten types of tokens: credit tokens, click tokens, tag tokens, bad publicity tokens, brain damage tokens, advancement tokens, virus counters, power counters, agenda counters, and condition counters.

         1. CREDIT TOKENS are used to track the number of credits each player has in their credit pool; they can also be placed on cards. Rules for credits, the credit pool, and other related concepts are in section 1.10.
         1. CLICK TOKENS are a gameplay aid used to track the clicks the active player has spent or has left to spend during their turn. Rules for clicks are in section 1.11.
         1. TAG TOKENS are used to represent tags on the Runner. Rules for tags are given in s ection 10.5.
         1. BAD PUBLICITY TOKENS represent bad publicity the Corp has earned. Rules for bad publicity are in section 10.6.
         1. BRAIN DAMAGE TOKENS are a gameplay aid used to track brain damage the Runner has suffered. Each point of brain damage the Runner suffers forces them to take a brain damage token. See section 10.4.
         1. ADVANCEMENT TOKENS are a token used primarily on installed agendas to track the Corp’s progress toward being able to score them.
         1. VIRUS COUNTERS are a generic token, used primarily by **virus** programs, that can be removed by the Corp purging them. See rule 10.1.1.
         1. POWER COUNTERS are a generic token used by a variety of cards. They have no special rules.
         1. AGENDA COUNTERS are a generic token used primarily on scored agendas. They have no special rules.
         1. CONDITION COUNTERS are tokens that have rules text. Their abilities are active as long as they are hosted on a card.
