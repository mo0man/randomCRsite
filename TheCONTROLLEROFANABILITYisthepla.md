# The CONTROLLER OF AN ABILITY is the player who triggered or is allowed to trigger that ability. By default, this is the player who controls the ability’s source. See also s ection 9.1.3.

         1. **Some abilities state that they can only be used by a specific player. The specified player controls each such ability, even if they do not control its source.**
      1. Unless otherwise noted, the controller of an ability carries out its effects and makes any choices required. If a player is specified to perform all or part of an effect, the specified player carries out that part of the effect and makes any choices required instead.

*Example: Rototurret’s first subroutine reads, “Trash 1 program.” Since Rototurret is a Corp card, the Corp chooses which installed program to trash. Conversely, Bulwark’s first subroutine reads, “The Runner trashes 1 program.” Since the Runner is specified to be carrying out this effect, they choose which of their installed programs to trash.*

         1. Some trigger conditions care about effects performed by a particular player. These conditions are only met when that player is the one to carry out the relevant effect.

*Example: The Corp has a rezzed Hostile Infrastructure. Apocalypse does not specify who trashes the cards, so the Runner is responsible for the trashing and Hostile Infrastructure **meets its trigger condition**.*

*Example: Alice Merchant states that “the Corp must trash 1 card from HQ”, so the Corp carries out this effect even though Alice Merchant is a Runner card, and therefore Hostile Infrastructure does not trigger.*
