# Playing Events and Operations

1. &nbsp;

      1. Normally, playing an operation or event requires paying its play cost. Abilities that initiate playing a card may ignore the play cost or require it to be paid.
         1. If a card has a play cost of X, the value for X is chosen by the player at the time the play cost is paid, according to any stipulations written on the card. This value of X is maintained while resolving the event or operation.
         1. After the play cost is paid, a checkpoint occurs, as required by rule 10.3.4.

      1. Playing cards is an exception to rule 9.11.2a. If an effect would play more than one card, then those cards are chosen and played one at a time, following all of the steps of the play process (section 8.6) for each card before choosing and playing the next. **Each such card is played as a separate instruction. See rule 9.10.4b.**

*Example: The Corp uses Subcontract to play Hedge Fund and another operation. The Corp can use the credits gained from Hedge Fund to pay for the second operation.*

      1. Operations and events can create **lingering** effects. Once those effects exist, they become independent of the source operation or event and the card is considered fully resolved and ready to be trashed. **See section 9.9.**

***Example: Test Run creates a delayed conditional ability that will resolve at the end of the turn, but Test Run itself is considered fully resolved and is trashed once it finishes installing a program.***

      1. An operation or event that initiates a timing structure remains active in the play area for the duration of that timing structure. It is not considered fully resolved until the timing structure is completed and any abilities on the card that **meet their trigger conditions** when the timing structure ends are resolved.
