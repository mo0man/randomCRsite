# Run Ends

   1. &nbsp;
      1. The RUN ENDS PHASE formalizes the end of the run and prepares the game to return to the timing structure from which the run was initiated.
      1. At the beginning of the Run Ends Phase, the game processes each priority window that was open when the run was ended. This is done according to the following procedure:
         1. If a paid ability window was open when the run was ended, the window closes. No player can trigger further paid abilities or resolve other options the window would normally allow (such as rezzing cards).

*Example: The Corp spends a counter from a scored Nisei Mk II to end the run. Once this happens, the Runner does not have an opportunity to use their bad publicity credits from this run to pay for using Self-Modifying Code.*

         1. If the reaction window for resolving subroutines (step 6.9.3c) was open when the run was ended, that reaction window closes. No more subroutines are resolved.

*Example: The Runner encounters Little Engine and does not break any subroutines. Since the first subroutine ends the run, the third subroutine will not resolve and the Runner will not gain credits.*

         1. If the run was ended during a reaction window opened due to a phase beginning, the reaction window closes, as per rule 9.2.8f. No other pending abilities are resolved.

*Example: The Runner uses the ability on Security Nexus during a reaction window at the beginning of the Encounter Ice Phase. The trace is successful, so the ability ends the run. If Tollbooth’s ability is also pending in this reaction window, it will not be resolved, since the encounter has ended.*

         1. Any other open priority window is completed normally. If more than one priority window needs to be completed this way, they are resolved in the usual order described in rule 9.1.2a.

*Example: The Corp resolves the ability on Giordano Memorial Field during a reaction window in the Approach Server Phase. This ability ends the run, but first the priority window is completed. If Embolus’s second ability is pending in the same reaction window (as it usually will be if both cards are rezzed), the Corp must remove a power counter from Embolus.*

      1. During the Run Ends Phase, if the Runner has any credits from bad publicity remaining in their credit pool, the Runner loses those credits.
      1. As part of the Run Ends Phase, the game determines whether the run should be declared an UNSUCCESSFUL RUN. This is a label applied to runs in which the Runner failed to reach the server they attacked, and is referred to by card abilities. The run is declared unsuccessful if neither of the following conditions have been met:
         1. If the run reached s tep 6.9.5e, the point at which it is declared successful, it is not declared unsuccessful. This is the case regardless of whether the run was actually declared successful by that step.

*Example: The Runner reaches a server with Crisium Grid rezzed. Crisium Grid’s ability stops the run from being declared successful, but the run is not declared unsuccessful either.*

      1. &nbsp;
         1. If the attacked server has ceased to exist, the run is not declared unsuccessful. See r ule 8.2.7.
      1. Abilities with “when a run ends,” “when a run is unsuccessful,” or “when a(n) (un)successful run ends” trigger conditions do not **meet their trigger conditions** during the Run Ends Phase. Rather, they are marked as pending by the checkpoint following the conclusion of the entire run. Thus, those abilities do not resolve during the run. See also r ule 10.3.5.

*Example: The Runner is playing Jesminder Sareen and has John Masanori installed. If the Runner makes an unsuccessful run, Jesminder Sareen will not avoid the tag from John Masanori’s second ability, because it is no longer during the run when the ability resolves.*
