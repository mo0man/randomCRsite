# If a player is directed to search a zone for cards “with different names,” each card that player finds must have a different English name from every other card found for that search.

      1. Once a search through a deck is complete, whether or not any cards are found, the deck must be immediately reshuffled before continuing to resolve any remaining effects from the ability that initiated the search. The shuffling takes precedence over anything that would be done with the found card(s), as well as any chain reactions that occur as a result of the search, finding, or remaining abilities.

*Example: The Corp is playing Near-Earth Hub and uses the ability on Tech Startup to search their deck for an asset and install it. After finding the asset, R\&D must be immediately shuffled before **the Corp installs the asset or triggers** Near-Earth Hub’s ability.*

      1. Once the search is complete, and any shuffling necessary has occurred, resolution of the ability that initiated the search resumes. If no cards were found during the search, any effects referencing found cards fail to resolve, but as much of the remaining effects resolve as possible.
      1. If the trigger condition of a conditional ability involves a search, that ability becomes pending **after the search is completed and any shuffling is performed, but before the found cards are acted on.**
