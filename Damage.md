# Damage

      1. Many cards and ice subroutines inflict damage on the Runner. The Runner SUFFERS (sometimes referred to as “TAKES”) damage according to the rules for the type of damage specified. If a Corp card “does” damage to the Runner, they suffer that much damage, with the additional provision that the Corp and the source card are responsible for that damage. If a card directs or allows the Runner to “suffer” damage, then the Runner and the source card are responsible for that damage.

*Example: The Corp, playing as Argus Security, has scored The Cleaners. The Runner makes a run on R\&D and steals Hostile Takeover. Argus Security’s ability triggers and the Runner chooses to suffer 2 meat damage. As The Cleaners only adds additional damage **to damage done by the Corp, its ability does not apply.** When the Corp plays Punitive Counterstrike on their next turn, The Cleaners **does increase the amount of damage** done by Punitive Counterstrike.*

      1. The three types of damage the Runner can suffer are meat, net, and brain damage.

         1. MEAT DAMAGE and NET DAMAGE are resolved the same way. For each point of damage suffered, one card is randomly trashed from the grip.
         1. For each point of BRAIN DAMAGE suffered, one card is randomly trashed from the grip and the Runner’s maximum hand size is permanently reduced by 1. The Runner takes a brain damage token for each brain damage suffered to track the reduction in hand size.
      1. If the Runner suffers more than 1 damage of any type, the cards are randomly trashed simultaneously.

*Example: The Runner has 2 tags and four cards in their grip, one of which is I’ve Had Worse. The Corp plays BOOM\!, dealing 7 meat damage to the Runner. If the Runner cannot or does not prevent at least 3 of the incoming damage, they immediately flatline as they have suffered more damage than they have cards in grip, and I’ve Had Worse does not have the opportunity to **resolve**. If the Runner does prevent enough of the damage to survive, the Runner randomly trashes as many cards as the remaining amount of damage. After all the cards have been randomly selected and placed in the heap, I’ve Had Worse **meets its trigger condition** if it is among those cards trashed by the damage.*

         1. If an effect modifies the procedure for dealing damage such that the cards trashed cannot be selected simultaneously, then the cards are selected sequentially but are still trashed simultaneously.

*Example: The Corp is playing as Chronos Protocol: Selective Mind Mapping when the Runner accesses a Snare\! before taking any other damage during this turn. The Corp looks at the grip and selects a card to be trashed as the first point of net damage for the turn, then two other cards are randomly selected. All 3 cards are trashed simultaneously.*

      1. If the Runner takes more damage than the number of cards in their grip, or if they have a maximum hand size of less than zero at the end of their turn, then they are FLATLINED and the Corp wins the game.
