# Link

*The Runner’s link is the number of points their path through the Net traverses between their rig and the Corp’s server. The more proxies, redirects, and other intermediary connecting points between the Corp and the Runner, the harder it is for sysops to track down the Runner’s virtual location.*

      1. The Runner’s LINK VALUE is calculated by adding the base link on their identity card to the link (\[link\]) produced by their installed cards.
      1. Link is primarily used to contest traces, as described in section 10.8, but other abilities can also refer to the Runner’s link value.
