      1. A RUN is a Runner’s attack on a server. There are 6 phases used in the procedure of carrying out a run, described in sections 6.3 through 6.8. A run always begins with the Initiation Phase. Section 6.9 contains the full set of steps carried out during each phase, and should be referred to in conjunction with the sections discussing the phases.
      1. The ATTACKED SERVER is the server the Runner is attempting to reach, usually to access cards in that server.
         1. The Runner **announces** the attacked server in the initiation phase of the run.

         1. Card abilities can sometimes change the attacked server during the run. This does not end the run, but it can affect whether or not certain card abilities or effects apply.
         1. If an ability changes the attacked server without specifying a position, the Runner approaches the outermost piece of ice protecting the new server. If there is no ice protecting that server, instead the Runner approaches the server.
      1. Many abilities modify the sequence of steps taken to resolve a run. Such abilities can direct players to skip steps or phases, replace steps with other effects, move directly from the current timing point to a new phase, or make other changes to the procedures explained in this section. Heed the Golden Rules in section 1.2.
         1. **An ability that directs** the Runner to approach a piece of ice moves the Runner to the beginning of the Approach Ice phase. See section 6.4.2. Note that such instructions may change the attacked server, as discussed in section 6.1.2.
         1. **An ability that directs** the Runner to encounter a piece of ice does not change the current timing point of the run unless it specifically says so, but rather, resolves an Encounter Ice phase independent of the current state of the run. See section 6.5.2.
         1. Any time players are instructed to move to a different phase of the run, except for an instruction to end the run (See rule 6.1.4, below), no more steps in the previously active phase are carried out. If a paid ability window is open, players complete that window normally. Then the active phase is complete and a checkpoint occurs (as required by rule 10.3.5). Finally, the game proceeds to the new phase.
      1. To END THE RUN is to halt the Runner’s progress toward the server. When an effect ends the run, the current phase of the run also ends (without following any of its remaining steps). Then, a checkpoint occurs (as required by rule 10.3.5). Finally, the game moves from the current timing point to step 6.9.6, the Run Ends phase.

      1. JACKING OUT is the process by which a Runner voluntarily ends a run. Jacking out follows the usual process for ending the run as described in rule 6.1.4, but some card abilities function differently depending on whether or not the Runner chose to end the run by jacking out.
         1. The Runner has opportunities to jack out while approaching a piece of ice and while approaching the attacked server.
         1. The Runner cannot jack out the first time they approach a piece of ice during a run.
