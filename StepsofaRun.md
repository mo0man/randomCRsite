# Steps of a Run

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Initiation Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner **announces** the attacked server.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. A checkpoint occurs.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner gains 1\[c\] to spend during the run for each bad publicity the Corp has.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The run formally begins. At this time, any “run begins” or “run initiated” abilities meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A checkpoint occurs.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Initiation Phase is complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs). If the attacked server has at least one piece of ice protecting it, the Runner proceeds to s tep 6.9.2, Approach Ice, approaching the outermost piece of ice protecting the

attacked server. If the attacked server is not protected by ice, the Runner moves to s tep 6.9.5, Approach Server.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Approach Ice Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. Any “when you approach” conditional abilities that apply to the current approach meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A paid ability window occurs, in which players may only use paid abilities. (P)

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. If this is the first time the Runner has approached a piece of ice during this run, skip to (e). If this is not the first approach this run, continue to (d).
         1. The Runner may choose to jack out, proceeding to step 6.9.6, Run Ends. If the Runner does not, continue to (e).
         1. A paid ability window occurs, in which players may use paid abilities and the Corp may rez non-ice cards. Additionally, the Corp may rez the approached piece of ice.
            1. (R)

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Approach Ice Phase is complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs). If the approached piece of ice is rezzed, continue to step 6.9.3, Encounter Ice. If the ice remains unrezzed, skip to s tep 6.9.4, Pass Ice.
      1. Encounter Ice Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. Any “when you encounter” conditional abilities that apply to the current encounter meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A paid ability window occurs, in which players may only use paid abilities. Subroutines on the encountered ice can be broken during this window. If this step is skipped, no subroutines on the encountered ice are broken. (P)
         1. Each unbroken subroutine becomes pending. A special reaction window opens for the pending subroutines, during which the Corp triggers and resolves those subroutines one by one in order. (If a subroutine ends the run, the encounter ends and the run moves to step 6.9.6, Run Ends).
         1. The Encounter Phase is complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs). Continue to step 6.9.4, Pass Ice.
      1. Pass Ice Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner passes the piece of ice. At this time any “When passed” abilities that apply to the current position meet their trigger conditions. If there are no more pieces of ice protecting the server in positions more inward than the ice just passed, any “passes all ice” abilities also meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A checkpoint occurs.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Pass Ice Phase is complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs). If there is another piece of ice protecting the server in a position more inward than the ice just passed, the Runner proceeds to step 6.9.2, Approach Ice, again, approaching

&nbsp;

the next inward piece of ice. If there are no more pieces of ice protecting the server in positions more inward than the ice just passed, the Runner continues to s tep

.5, Approach Server.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Approach Server Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner approaches the attacked server. At this time any “approach server” abilities meet their trigger conditions. If no ice was protecting the server and this step was reached directly from the Initiation Phase, any “passes all ice” abilities also meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A paid ability window occurs, in which players may only use paid abilities. (P)

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner may choose to jack out, proceeding to step 6.9.6, Run Ends. If the Runner does not, continue to (d).
         1. A paid ability window occurs, in which players may use paid abilities and the Corp may rez non-ice cards. (P) (R)
         1. The run is declared successful. At this time, any “make a successful run” abilities meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A checkpoint occurs.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. The Runner accesses cards from the attacked server as described in rule 6.7.4 and s ection 7.
         1. The Approach Server Phase is complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs). Continue to step 6.9.6, Run Ends.
      1. Run Ends Phase

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. Any priority windows that were open when the run moved to this phase are completed or closed as described in s ection 6.8.2.
         1. The Runner loses any unspent bad publicity credits.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. If step 6.9.5e of the run was not reached during this run and the attacked server still exists, the run becomes unsuccessful.
         1. The Run Ends Phase and the run as a whole are both complete (and the end-of-phase checkpoint occurs).
