# Traces

*A trace is the Corp’s attempt to connect from their servers back to the Runner. Many traces can allow the Corp to gain information about the Runner, tagging them, but traces can also produce a wide variety of other effects. Traces most commonly originate from ice subroutines, but Corporate operations can produce some of the nastiest trace effects.*

      1. Some card abilities initiate a TRACE ATTEMPT (sometimes simply called a TRACE) on the Runner. Traces are marked by the language “Trace \[N\]” on a card, where the given value N is the BASE TRACE STRENGTH of the trace. A trace pits the Corp’s trace

strength against the Runner’s link strength, both of which can be increased by spending credits.

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. The Corp acts first during a trace attempt, openly spending any number of credits. This sets the TRACE STRENGTH, which is the base trace strength plus the number of credits spent.
      1. After the Corp spends their credits, the Runner has the opportunity to spend credits to establish their link strength. The Runner’s LINK STRENGTH is equal to their link value plus the number of credits spent.
      1. After the Runner’s link strength is established, it is compared to the Corp’s trace strength. If the trace strength exceeds the link strength, the trace attempt is successful and any “If successful” **abilities** associated with the trace **meet their trigger conditions**. If the link strength is equal to or greater than the trace strength, then the trace attempt is unsuccessful, and any “If unsuccessful” **abilities** associated with the trace **meet their trigger conditions**.
      1. “If successful” and “if unsuccessful” effects following the “Trace \[N\]” indicator are **conditional abilities tied to** the results of the trace. **Any instructions in the body of the trace without an “if successful” or “if unsuccessful” are conditional abilities with the implicit trigger condition, “when the trace is determined to be successful or unsuccessful.”**

***Example: Gemini’s subroutine initiates a trace attempt with two associated conditional abilities. The first is “If successful, do 1 net damage.” and the second is “When the trace is determined to be successful or unsuccessful, if your trace strength is 5 or greater, do 1 net damage.” Both of these will become pending (if appropriate) at step 10.8.6f below.***

      1. Steps of Resolving a Trace Attempt
         1. The trace initiates. At this time, any “when a trace is initiated” abilities meet their trigger conditions.
         1. A checkpoint occurs.
