# Bypass

         1. When an effect allows the Runner to BYPASS a piece of ice, the Encounter Ice Phase is aborted and the Runner immediately proceeds to pass that ice.

         1. Most bypass effects occur at the beginning of an encounter and cause steps 6.9.3b and 6.9.3c to be skipped, meaning that subroutines on the encountered ice are neither broken nor resolved.
         1. A few bypass effects can be triggered later. If ice is bypassed in step 6.9.3b, subroutines may or may not have been broken, but step 6.9.3c is skipped so no subroutines resolve. Note that for ice with zero subroutines, the Runner has “broken all subroutines” if and only if step 6.9.3b was reached. **See rule 9.11.2c.**

*Example: The Runner plays Forked and encounters a Troll that they can bypass with Femme Fatale. The Runner pays to bypass the current piece of ice with Femme Fatale. Forked does not meet its trigger condition, and Troll is not trashed, because the opportunity to break subroutines was never reached.*

      1. During the paid ability window in the Encounter Ice Phase (s&nbsp; tep 6.9.3b), the Runner can break subroutines on the ice. Subroutines remain broken for the duration of the encounter, then lose that status during the next checkpoint after the encounter ends.
         1. Many cards that can break subroutines are **icebreakers**. See section 3.9.5 for rules about using **icebreakers**.
      1. After the paid ability window in the Encounter Ice Phase closes, unbroken subroutines on the encountered ice resolve. This step is handled as a special reaction window during which only the Corp receives priority. Each unbroken subroutine on the encountered ice becomes a mandatory pending ability in that window. Instead of choosing the order to trigger and resolve pending abilities, the Corp must trigger the pending subroutines in the order they appear on the ice. See rule 9.2.8 for details of reaction windows, and

s ection 9.6 for information on triggering and resolving these abilities.

         1. If an effect ends the run, any remaining pending subroutines lose their pending status and do not trigger or resolve, and the reaction window for resolving subroutines closes. See section 6.8.2 for more details.
