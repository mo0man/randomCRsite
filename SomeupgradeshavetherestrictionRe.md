# Some upgrades have the restriction "Remote server only." The only location in the play area that such a card can occupy while it is installed is in a remote server. See rule 8.2.12.

         1. **The Corp card *Earth Station: SEA Headquarters* and its reverse, *Earth Station: Ascending to Orbit*, both have the ability, “Limit 1 remote server.” While this ability is active, as long as a remote server exists, the Corp cannot create a new remote server. If at any time more than 1 remote server exists while this ability is active, the next checkpoint will force the Corp player to choose 1 of those servers. The checkpoint will then trash all cards in and protecting each other remote server. See step 10.3.1e.**
      1. Protecting a Server
         1. Installed ice is arranged in a horizontal position in front of the server it is protecting. While installed, ice can be classified by its position in relation to the server it is protecting, measured by the number of other pieces of ice between it and the server.
         1. If there is no other ice between the server and a piece of ice, that ice is the innermost piece of ice. If there is no ice farther from the server than a piece of ice, that ice is the outermost piece of ice. If there is only one piece of ice protecting a server, that ice is both the innermost and the outermost piece of ice.
         1. If two pieces of ice protecting two different servers share the same number of ice between them and their respective servers, those pieces of ice are considered to be in the same position.
         1. When the Corp installs a piece of ice protecting a server, they must place it in the outermost position protecting that server. See section 8.2.
         1. If the number of other ice between a piece of ice and the server changes, its position will change accordingly, moving either closer or farther from the server. If this occurs while that ice is being approached, encountered, or passed during a run, the Runner’s position **attacking** the server changes in the same way.
