# The Golden Rules

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. If the text of a card directly contradicts these rules, the text of the card takes precedence.

      1. If a rule or ability directs something to happen, but another effect states that it cannot happen, the “cannot” ability takes precedence.
         1. If a “cannot” effect prohibits all of the effects of another ability, that ability cannot be triggered.
         1. If a “cannot” effect prohibits only part of another ability, that ability can be triggered, but the prohibited steps of resolving that ability are not carried out.

*Example: During a run, Lockdown’s subroutine resolves, preventing the Runner from drawing cards for the remainder of the turn. The Runner has a Diesel and a Process Automation in their grip. For the remainder of this turn, they cannot play Diesel as its entire ability is prohibited, but they can play Process Automation. Even though cards cannot be drawn through Process Automation, the Runner can play it to gain 2\[c\].*

      1. If an instruction includes the words “if able,” it can only be carried out fully or not at all. If any part of the instruction is not possible to carry out, the entire instruction is ignored.
      1. If an instruction does not include the words “if able,” as much of that instruction as possible is carried out. Any parts of the instruction that are not possible to carry out are ignored.
      1. A player can only take an action or use an ability if its effect has the potential to change the game state. This potential is assessed strictly by what the action or ability **can be expected to** accomplish, without regard to the consequences of paying any costs to

&nbsp;

initiate that action or ability and without regard to any other abilities that may **meet their conditions in the process of** initiating or resolving that action or ability.

*Example 1: The Corp has one unrezzed piece of ice installed and Liquidation in HQ. As Liquidation requires the Corp to have at least one rezzed card to trash, the Corp cannot play Liquidation as it cannot change the game state.*

*Example 2: The Corp has one rezzed piece of ice installed and Liquidation in HQ. Because the Corp has at least one rezzed card that could be trashed (which would change the game state), they can play Liquidation, spending a click and paying its play cost. The Corp then chooses any number of their rezzed cards to trash, which could be zero cards.*

*Example 3: The Runner is playing Armand “Geist” Walker and has Forger installed. The Runner can only trash Forger and trigger Geist’s ability when they are about to take a tag (which Forger could avoid) or while they have a tag (which Forger could remove). Using Forger at any other time has no potential to change the game state.*
