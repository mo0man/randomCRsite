# The SET-ASIDE ZONE is an inactive zone shared by both players. It is used as a temporary holding space for cards being affected by abilities.

      1. **If a card is “set aside”, it is moved from its current zone to the set-aside zone.**

&nbsp;

   1. &nbsp;
      1. **An ability cannot see the set-aside zone unless it specifically sets cards aside or refers to set-aside cards. Outside of these cases, cards moved into another zone from the set-aside zone are treated as though they entered that zone directly from their location prior to being set aside.**

&nbsp;

***Example: The Runner is playing as Exile and plays Test Run, searching their heap for a program. Although the program is set aside before being installed, Exile’s ability treats it as though it were installed directly from the heap, and so Exile will draw a card.***

      1. **Cards found during a search are set aside facedown while the search completes (in particular, while any deck that was searched is shuffled). See section 4.2.**
      1. **Some paid abilities with a trigger cost that uninstalls or forfeits the ability’s source card need to act on that card’s hosted cards or counters. These abilities set aside the hosted cards or counters as the trigger cost is paid. See rule 9.1.12a.**
      1. **Cards set aside by a card ability are faceup unless the ability specifically instructs that they be set aside facedown.**
   1. Removed from the Game
      1. The REMOVED FROM GAME ZONE is an inactive zone shared by both players. It is used to take cards out of any player’s control until the end of the game.
      1. If a card is removed from the game, it is moved from its current zone to the removed from game zone.
      1. Forfeiting an agenda removes it from the game. See s ection 10.1.2.

      1. Cards that have been removed from the game are inactive. Their abilities are inactive even if they fall under one of the exceptions that would normally apply to inactive cards.
      1. Unless a card effect explicitly says otherwise, a card that has been removed from the game cannot move out of the removed from game zone or otherwise be interacted with.
      1. Cards that have been removed from the game are open information. Any player may look through or count the cards that have been removed from the game at any time.
