         1. Either player can win by collecting agenda points in their score area (usually done by scoring or stealing agendas; see section 1.16). A player with a score of 7 or more wins the game.

The Runner is also flatlined if, at the beginning of their discard phase, their maximum hand size is less than 0. See section 10.4 for more information about damage.
         1. The Runner wins if the Corp is required to draw a card from R\&D but cannot because R\&D is empty.
