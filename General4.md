      1. ACCESSING is the process of the Runner looking at and interacting with the Corp’s cards. Accessing usually occurs during a successful run.

         1. The Runner can access multiple cards in a single run, or when accessing cards directly through abilities. To ACCESS A SERVER or ACCESS CARDS FROM A SERVER means to access the set of cards prescribed for that server in sections 7.2 through 7.5.
         1. If an ability directs the Runner to access “the top card of R\&D,” “1 card from HQ,” or “all cards in Archives,” that direction means the Runner accesses the corresponding central server. Any abilities that apply “whenever the Runner accesses cards” are able to modify the set of cards accessed.

*Example: The Runner has Gang Sign and HQ Interface installed. When the Corp scores an agenda, Gang Sign will allow the Runner to access HQ. HQ Interface’s ability will apply to that access, so the Runner will access 2 cards.*

         1. Whenever a set of cards is accessed, whether that set was determined through the rules for a particular server or specified through other means, the Runner follows the steps in section 7.6 to structure those accesses. In step 7.6.5 of that structure, the Runner accesses one of the individual cards in the set. The rules for accessing an individual card are given in s ection 7.7, and the sequence of steps carried out is given in section 7.8.
      1. When the Runner accesses a server, the number of cards they will access is set before any individual cards are accessed. The rules for accessing that server determine the base number of cards that are accessed. Abilities can increase or decrease that number of cards, but not beyond the total number of cards available at the time the access begins.
         1. If a central server is accessed **during step 6.9.5g of a run**, that server’s root is also accessed. The number of upgrades in that root is added to the total number of cards to access.
         1. If an ability instructs the Runner to access a central server outside the normal structure of a run, that server’s root is not accessed.
         1. If cards are added to the server in the middle of access, the number of cards to be accessed does not change.

*Example: The Runner plays Legwork while the Corp has 2 cards in HQ and 1 upgrade in the root of HQ. The rules for accessing HQ specify that 1 card is accessed by default.*

*Legwork allows the Runner to access 2 additional cards, plus the upgrade in the root of HQ adds another 1 card. So the Runner would be able to access 4 cards during this run. However, there are only 3 actual cards available to access, so the number of cards to be accessed is fixed at 3. If other cards enter HQ after the individual card accesses begin, perhaps because the Runner steals Bacterial Programming, the Runner still only accesses a total of 3 cards, one of which must be the upgrade installed in the root of HQ.*

         1. If the number of cards available to access is reduced after access begins, the Runner’s total number of cards to be accessed remains the same. The Runner will

&nbsp;

attempt to access the number of cards that was initially set until it is reached or all cards in the server (and its root, if appropriate), have been accessed.

*Example: The Runner, playing Leela Patel, makes a successful run on HQ, and the number of cards to be accessed is set at 3. The first card accessed is Disposable HQ, and the Corp uses its “when accessed” ability to put all the cards in HQ but an agenda on the bottom of R\&D. Leela accesses the agenda, and returns a card in play to HQ. Leela is able to access the returned card, since there is still 1 card remaining in the set number of cards to be accessed.*

      1. A card with an ability that **meets its trigger condition** when that card is accessed does not have to be active in order for the ability to **be triggered**. See section 9.1.6.
      1. Except for cards in R\&D, the Runner can access cards from a server (and its root, if applicable) in any order. See section 7.2 regarding the order of accessing cards from R\&D.
      1. When the Runner accesses cards from anywhere other than R\&D, which cards are being accessed is open information, and the current card being accessed at each point is visible to both players.
      1. Each individual card can be accessed only once in a single instance of accessing a server or other set of cards.
         1. If a card is moved to a different **zone** and then returns to the server being accessed, or if a card that has been accessed from R\&D is moved to a different **location** in R\&D, it is considered a new copy of that card and can be accessed again.
