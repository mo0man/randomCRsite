# Accessing Individual Cards

1. &nbsp;

      1. Each card is accessed one at a time, and all effects associated with accessing that card must be fully resolved before any other cards are accessed, unless an ability initiates a new timing structure during that access.

      1. If the accessed card has a trash cost, the Runner may pay that cost to trash the accessed card. If abilities allow the Runner to trash the accessed card by other means, the Runner may use those abilities at the time they would pay the cardâ€™s trash cost, even if the accessed card has no trash cost.
         1. The Runner cannot trash or pay the trash cost of cards in Archives.

         1. If the Runner uses an ability to trash an agenda they access, the agenda cannot be stolen during this access.
      1. If the accessed card is an agenda, the Runner must steal it as long as there are no additional costs to do so. If there are any additional costs, the Runner can pay those costs and steal the agenda or decline to pay the costs and not steal the agenda.
      1. Once the above steps have been completed, the access ends. If the card was stolen or trashed, it is moved to the relevant zone. If it was neither stolen nor trashed, it remains in its initial location but is set aside until the Runner finishes accessing any other cards associated with this access.
