# There are 7 zone types: deck, hand, discard pile, score area, play area, set aside, and removed from the game.

         1. **Each player has their own deck, hand, discard pile, and score area. All players share the play area, the set-aside zone, and the removed-from-game zone.**
         1. **Each card in the game exists in exactly 1 zone at a time.**

      1. Game rules and card effects can move cards between zones.

         1. Whenever a card moves to or within a hidden or secret zone, any effects, including pending **conditional** abilities, that targeted or applied to that card can no longer act on it.

*Example: If the Corp uses The Foundry after the first install from among the cards looked at by Accelerated Beta Test, then the other cards currently being looked at by Accelerated Beta Test are shuffled along with the rest of R\&D, and the rest of Accelerated Beta Testâ€™s abilities cannot resolve. Since the cards were moved to an unknown location in R\&D, they can no longer be looked at, installed, or trashed.*

         1. If a facedown card or a card in a hidden zone would ever move to another zone as part of an effect that requires that card to have a specific attribute, that card must be revealed before being moved to the new zone unless it is being installed.

&nbsp;

*Example: When resolving Clone Suffrage Movement, the Corp chooses a facedown Fast Break in Archives. The Corp must reveal the Fast Break before adding it to HQ, to demonstrate that it is indeed an operation, meeting Clone Suffrage Movement's requirement.*
