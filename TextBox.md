      1. The TEXT BOX is the central area on a card containing any abilities the card has. Abilities usually only apply when the card they appear on is active. Rule 9.1.6 details exceptions.
      1. Many cards have italicised text written after their game text. This is FLAVOR TEXT, and has no effect on the game or the function of the card, nor can other abilities reference or interact with it.
