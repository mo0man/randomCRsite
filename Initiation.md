# Initiation

      1. The INITIATION PHASE prepares the game state for the run and resolves any trigger conditions related to the start of the run.
      1. During the Initiation Phase, the Runner **announces** a server to be the attacked server.

         1. Some abilities state that the Runner “cannot run on” or “cannot initiate a run on” certain servers under certain conditions. These effects refer to the **announcement** of the attacked server in the Initiation Phase.

&nbsp;

*Example: Off the Grid states in part, “The Runner cannot initiate a run on this server.” This only prohibits the Runner from **announcing** this particular remote server as the attacked server at the beginning of the run. If an ability changes the attacked server while a run is in progress, Off the Grid does not interfere with that ability.*

         1. Some abilities impose an additional cost to run, either generally or on a particular server. Any costs to run a server must be paid at the time that server is **announced** as the attacked server.
         1. Some abilities look for particular conditions occurring “during a run” or are restricted to being used “during a run.” For purposes of abilities, the run formally begins only after the attacked server is **announced** and any costs are paid.

*Example: The Runner initiates a run against a server with a rezzed Heinlein Grid while the Corp has Enhanced Login Protocol in play. They do not lose any credits to Heinlein Grid’s ability, as the additional click Enhanced Login Protocol requires them to spend is spent to initiate the run, and is not spent during the run.*

      1. During the Initiation Phase, the Runner receives credits equal to the number of bad publicity the Corp has. See section 10.6 for an explanation of bad publicity.
         1. Credits from bad publicity cannot be spent to pay costs to make the run, as they are received after the attacked server is **announced**.
         1. Once they are received, credits from bad publicity are in the Runner’s credit pool and behave just as any other credits. They can be spent, lost, placed on cards, and so on as normally allowed.
         1. During the Run Ends Phase, any credits from bad publicity remaining in the Runner’s credit pool are lost.
      1. When the initiation phase completes, the Runner approaches the outermost piece of ice protecting the attacked server, or if there is no ice protecting that server, approaches the server itself. See the Approach Ice Phase, section 6.4, and the Approach Server Phase, s ection 6.7.
