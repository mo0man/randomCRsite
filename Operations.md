# Operations

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Operations are the only Corp cards that are played. Operations are never installed. Playing an operation causes its abilities to become active, and once those abilities are fully resolved the operation is trashed. See section 8.5.
         1. Some operations have the subtype **condition**. As part of their abilities, **condition** operations convert themselves into condition counters and install themselves. A **condition** operation cannot be installed by an install effect; it can only be installed through its own conversion ability. See rule 10.1.4.
         1. Some operations have the subtype **current**. As part of their abilities, **current** operations prevent themselves from being trashed until another **current** operation or event is played or the Runner steals an agenda. When one of these occurs, the active **current** is trashed during the next checkpoint. See s ection 10.3.
