# To LOAD a card with counters is to place those counters on that card. A card is EMPTY when it is no longer hosting any counters of a type that were previously loaded onto it.

      1. **An ability on a card that refers to that card becoming empty is always linked to a preceding ability on that same card that loaded it with counters.**

***Example: The Runner installs Crowdfunding, and its first ability becomes pending. Even though there are no credits hosted on Crowdfunding until that ability resolves, the following "When it is empty, ..." ability does not meet its trigger condition because the card has not yet been loaded.***

      1. **If any other types of counters are placed on that card without having been loaded, and those counters are subsequently removed, then empty abilities on that card do not meet their condition.**
      1. **Loading a card with counters does not impose any further restrictions upon those counters for that card. Other abilities can still issue instructions to act upon counters of that type, including but not limited to placing more of them or removing some of them.**
   1. Infinite Loops
      1. If a mandatory infinite loop is created (a player cannot choose to stop resolving the loop) then the player who is resolving the loop chooses a number. The loop instantaneously resolves that many times, and then ends.

*Example: The Runner runs into a rezzed Wormhole. The only other piece of ice that is rezzed is a Wormhole, and so a mandatory infinite loop is created where each of the Wormholes’ subroutines resolves the other. The Corp chooses how many times this loop occurs, say 2,157 times, and then the Runner continues the run.*

   1. &nbsp;
      1. If an optional infinite loop is created (a player can choose to stop resolving the loop) during a run, then the Runner must jack out unless another card ability prevents them from doing so. If the Runner cannot jack out, then it is the Corp’s responsibility to end the loop by letting the Runner continue the run.
