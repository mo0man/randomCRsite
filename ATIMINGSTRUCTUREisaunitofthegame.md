# A TIMING STRUCTURE is a unit of the game in which a prescribed sequence of steps progress the game forward. Each timing structure ends with an implicit checkpoint. See section 10.3.

   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **The Corp’s turn and the Runner’s turn are timing structures, as are each of the 3 phases of the turns. See section 5.**
         1. **A run is a timing structure, as are each of the 6 phases of a run. See section 6 .**
         1. **Accessing a set of cards is a timing structure. See section 7.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Accessing an individual card is a timing structure. See section 7.7 and s ection 7.8.**
      1. **PRIORITY is a player’s opportunity to act and make certain game choices. No more than one player can have priority at any given time.**
      1. **A PRIORITY WINDOW is a general term for a timing step in which one or both players receive priority. Priority windows OPEN for different purposes throughout the game. When a priority window CLOSES, the game continues to the next timing step.**
         1. **All priority windows give the player with priority the option to choose a relevant ability they control (if there are any) as the next ability for the game to resolve. This is often referred to as TRIGGERING the chosen ability. Some priority windows also give players other options.**
         1. **Except during action windows, the player with priority has the option to PASS in addition to the available options defined by that priority window. When a player passes, the game progresses to the next step, either by giving priority**

&nbsp;

**to the other player or by closing the priority window. Each type of priority window defines the method and resolution of passing.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Unless otherwise noted, the player with priority receives priority again after resolving one of their available options. That player will continue to receive priority until they pass.**
         1. **While a priority window is open, another nested priority window can open as well. This nesting allows the game to resolve “chain reactions,” as discussed in rule 9.1.2a. The most recently opened priority window is always resolved before returning to an earlier priority window.**
         1. **Whenever a player receives priority during a priority window, a checkpoint occurs immediately before that player may act. See section 10.3.**
      1. **The types of priority windows are action windows, paid ability windows, reaction windows, and interrupt windows.**
      1. **An ACTION WINDOW is a priority window that opens during a player’s action phase if they have unspent clicks.**
         1. **An action window gives only the active player priority.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **During an action window, the active player must take an action. Section 5.2 discusses actions. This type of window does not give the option to pass.**
         1. **After the active player takes an action, the action window closes and the game moves to the next timing step. The player does not receive priority again.**
         1. **There are two timing steps during which an action window may open. The Corp has an action window in s tep 5.6.2b of their action phase. The Runner has an action window in step 5.7.1f of their action phase.**
      1. **A PAID ABILITY WINDOW is a priority window that opens throughout the game’s timing structures to allow players to trigger paid abilities, rez cards, or score agendas.**
         1. **Paid ability windows give both players priority, starting with the active player. When a player passes, the other player receives priority. Players continue to exchange priority until a player who receives priority from their opponent passes without resolving any other option available to them. Once this happens, the paid ability window closes.**
         1. **During every paid ability window, the player with priority has the option to trigger an active paid ability they control. Within this document, the symbol**
            1. **denotes a paid ability window in which paid abilities can be used. See s ection 9.5.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **During some paid ability windows, the Corp has the option to rez an asset or upgrade while they have priority. Within this document, the symbol (R) denotes a paid ability window in which cards can be rezzed. See section 8.**
         1. **During some paid ability windows, the Corp has the option to score an agenda while they have priority. Within this document, the symbol (S) denotes a paid ability window in which agendas can be scored. See section 1 .16.**
         1. **During the paid ability window at s tep 6.9.2e of the Approach Ice phase of a run, the Corp has the option to rez the piece of ice the Runner is approaching while they have priority.**
         1. **The player with priority during a paid ability window may use any of the options available to them any number of times in any combination and order until they decide to pass, so long as they are allowed and the player pays any and all costs to use each option. Each option must be fully resolved before another is chosen. A player is not obligated to resolve any of the options available to them, except they must pass.**
         1. **Paid ability windows occur throughout the timing steps of turns and runs.**

**S ection 5.6, section 5.7, and section 6.9 detail those steps and indicate which options are available in which windows. Section 12 also contains a summarized version of these steps.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **A REACTION WINDOW is a priority window that opens whenever one or more active conditional abilities become pending by meeting their conditions. S ection 9.6 discusses conditional abilities.**
         1. **Each reaction window is associated with the fixed set of conditional abilities that met their conditions just before the window opened. If other abilities become pending during a reaction window, a separate reaction window opens to handle the new abilities. See rule 9.1.2a.**
         1. **Reaction windows give both players priority, starting with the active player. When the active player passes, the inactive player receives priority. When the inactive player passes, the reaction window closes.**
         1. **During a reaction window, the player with priority has the option to trigger a pending conditional ability they control that is associated with that window.**
         1. **The player with priority during a reaction window may trigger their pending abilities in any order until they decide to pass; they do not need to trigger mandatory abilities before optional ones. Each ability they trigger must be fully resolved before another is chosen.**
         1. **The player with priority cannot pass if they control any pending mandatory abilities. They may pass with optional conditional abilities still pending, in which case those abilities lose their pending status without being triggered.**

&nbsp;

**S ection 9.6.9 describes the differences between mandatory and optional conditional abilities.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a reaction window opens due to a timing structure beginning, and during that reaction window the timing structure ends (e.g. by an effect moving the game to another timing point past the end of the structure), then the reaction window immediately closes. All remaining abilities associated with the window lose their pending status without being triggered, even if they are mandatory abilities.**

***Example: The Runner has a Femme Fatale installed and chose a Tollbooth with its “when installed” ability. When the Runner encounters the Tollbooth, they pay 1\[c\] to bypass the Tollbooth with Femme Fatale. Because the resolution of Femme Fatale’s ability causes the encounter to end, the pending ability from Tollbooth cannot be triggered. The Runner does not pay 3\[c\], and the run does not end.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **An INTERRUPT WINDOW is a priority window that opens just before an instruction would resolve when one or more players have abilities that could modify that imminent instruction. See section 9.8 for rules about interrupt abilities.**
         1. **Each interrupt window is associated with the single imminent instruction being modified by the abilities triggered during the window, and with a fixed set of conditional ability interrupts determined as the window opens.**
         1. **As an interrupt window opens, before players receive priority, the expected effects of the imminent instruction are determined, any applicable replacement effects are applied, and then relevant conditional abilities become pending. See section 9.8.4.**
         1. **Interrupt windows give both players priority, starting with the active player. When a player passes, the other player receives priority. Players continue to exchange priority until a player who receives priority from their opponent passes without resolving any other option available to them. Once this happens, the interrupt window closes.**
         1. **During an interrupt window, the player with priority has the option to trigger an interrupt ability they control that is relevant to the imminent effect. See**

**s ection 9.8.2.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **The player with priority during an interrupt window may trigger their abilities in any order until they decide to pass. They do not need to trigger mandatory abilities before optional abilities or trigger conditional abilities before paid abilities. Each ability they trigger must be fully resolved before another is chosen.**
         1. **The player with priority cannot pass if they control any pending mandatory abilities that are still relevant to the imminent effect. They may pass with optional conditional abilities still pending. (Section 9.6.9 describes the differences between mandatory and optional conditional abilities.) Once a**

&nbsp;

**player has passed, if they receive priority again, they may continue to trigger paid abilities and pending conditional abilities that are relevant. As the interrupt window closes, any remaining pending conditional abilities lose their pending status.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Interpreting Card Text**
      1. **Text is classified into conditions, restrictions, instructions, and declarations. The rules text of an ability can contain text in any combination of these classes, except that no ability contains both instructions and declarations.**
      1. **A CONDITION is a unit of text that stipulates a requirement for when an ability’s effects are allowed to apply.**
         1. **A COST CONDITION describes a cost (either a nested cost or a trigger cost) that a player must pay to apply an effect. Costs are discussed in detail in**

**s ection 1.15.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **A TRIGGER CONDITION describes a change in game state that must occur for an effect to apply. Trigger conditions often begin with words such as “if”, “when”, “whenever”, or “after”, or with ordinal phrases such as “the first time”.**
         1. **A STATIC CONDITION describes a property of the game state that must be true for an effect to apply. Static conditions often begin with words such as “if”, “during”, or “while”.**
      1. **A RESTRICTION is a unit of text that applies one of a specific set of constraints for a card to be played or an ability to be used. If a restriction appears in an ability, it applies to the entire ability regardless of whether it is written before, after, or in the middle of the ability’s other text. Many restrictions fall under section 9.1.8, meaning they are active even while their source is inactive.**
         1. **Text modifying the cost to play, install, rez, or steal the card it appears on is a restriction, including text that adds an additional cost.**
         1. **Constraints on when or where a card can be installed, rezzed, played, or scored are restrictions.**
         1. **Limits on when, where, or how often an ability can be used are restrictions.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Constraints on how a cost can be paid are restrictions.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a card’s text limits what cards it can host, the text describing that limit is a restriction. See also rule 1.12.5b.**
         1. **Definitions for or constraints on a variable are restrictions.**

&nbsp;

***Example: Some abilities dictate a value for X, such as “X is the number of rezzed NEXT ice.” Some abilities with X in their cost constrain the value that can be***

&nbsp;

***chosen for X, such as “X is equal to or less than the number of tags the Runner has.” These statements are restrictions.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Stipulations that an effect or part of an effect cannot be prevented are restrictions.**
         1. **Any text not falling under one of the above categories is not a restriction.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **An INSTRUCTION is a statement or command that is resolved at a specific time and applies immediate effects to the game state. (This can include creating new lingering abilities or effects that will continue to apply over time; see section 9.9.)**
         1. **Instructions can originate from a game rule or from the text of an ability. An instruction in an ability resolves when that ability resolves (see r ule 9.1.2). An instruction in the game rules resolves during the timing step(s) when it appears.**
         1. **If an instruction requires any targets, players announce those targets before that instruction becomes imminent. See section 1.14.**
         1. **Each instruction is carried out as an atomic unit and cannot be interrupted once it begins to resolve. The procedure for carrying out an instruction can be altered by other effects such as interrupts, but only before the instruction begins to resolve. See section 9.8.**
         1. **Other than choosing targets, carry out the steps of a single instruction in the order they are written.**
         1. **Instructions in an ability can create effects that last beyond the resolution of the ability. See section 9.9.**
      1. **A DECLARATION is a statement describing an effect on components or game rules that is applied continuously. A declaration applies its effects as long as it is active.**
      1. **The four types of abilities can be identified by the types of text they are made of.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Static abilities (section 9.4) can contain declarations, restrictions, and conditions, but never instructions. Static abilities are the only ability type that can contain declarations.**
         1. **Paid abilities (section 9.5) can always be identified by their formatting: a cost condition in bold text, a colon (:), then the remainder of the ability. The text after the colon can contain conditions, restrictions, and/or instructions.**
         1. **Conditional abilities (section 9.6) always contain a trigger condition or static condition and at least one instruction. They can also contain restrictions, other instructions, or nested conditions. The primary condition is often written with a timing-related word or phrase like "when", "after", "the first time", and so on, and is usually the first part of the ability’s text. Some older**

&nbsp;

**cards write the condition at the end of the ability or use "if" to indicate the condition.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Play abilities (section 9.7) are the abilities on events and operations that are not paid, conditional, or static abilities. They can contain conditions, restrictions, and/or instructions.**
   1. **Static Abilities**
      1. **A STATIC ABILITY is an ability that continuously affects the game as long as it is active. Static abilities are the only type of ability that can contain declarations, and they do not resolve or have associated priority windows.**
      1. **If a static ability contains a static condition, then the constrained parts of the ability apply to the game state only if that condition is met.**
      1. **Static abilities can include restrictions that apply to their source card. These restrictions are often active even while the card is inactive. See s ection 9.1.8.**
      1. **The effects of static abilities do not have durations and cannot directly create lingering effects (see section 9.9).**

***Example: The runner controls Puffer with a hosted Gebrselassie. Gebrselassie changes the durations of abilities affecting its host’s strength, so if the Runner uses Puffer’s paid ability to give it +1 strength, that increase will last for the remainder of the turn.***

***Gebrselassie does not affect Puffer’s static ability that increases its strength for each hosted power counter, so if the Runner spends \[click\] to remove a power counter, then the increase in strength from Puffer’s static ability will immediately be lost.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Static abilities that modify a value maintain the same restrictions and specifications that were present on the original value.**

***Example: The Cleaners has a static ability that gives every instance of meat damage done by the Corp +1 to the amount of the damage. Part of Flare’s effect does 2 meat damage that can’t be prevented. If this effect resolves while The Cleaners is active, then all 3 points of meat damage are unpreventable.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Paid Abilities**
      1. **A PAID ABILITY is an ability players trigger at-will, during appropriate priority windows. In order to use a paid ability, the controller of that ability must pay its TRIGGER COST. Paid abilities are always written with the trigger cost first, followed by a colon (:), followed by the remainder of the ability’s text.**
      1. **A player can trigger paid abilities they control while they have priority in an appropriate priority window.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If the trigger cost of a paid ability includes one or more \[click\], the ability is an ACTION. A player can use one action paid ability during each action window on their turn. See section 9.2.6 and section 5.2.**
         1. **If the \[interrupt\] symbol appears before a paid ability’s trigger cost, that ability is an interrupt. A player can use interrupt paid abilities during appropriate interrupt windows. Each such ability can be used as many times as its effects could apply to the imminent instruction. See section 9.8.**
         1. **A non-action, non-interrupt paid ability can be used during any paid ability window. Each such ability can be used an unlimited number of times as long as its cost is paid each time and any restrictions specified by its effect are observed.**
      1. **Paid abilities are always optional. A paid ability and its source are considered used when the ability’s trigger cost is paid.**
      1. **Once a player pays the trigger cost of a paid ability, that ability becomes independent of its source and rule 9.1.4 applies to it.**
      1. **If a paid ability will move cards or counters hosted on its source to another location, and the trigger cost uninstalls or forfeits that host card, set those cards or counters aside as the trigger cost is paid. The set-aside cards or counters are still considered “hosted” for purposes of this ability, but they are not trashed due to not having a host for as long as the ability is resolving. When the ability finishes resolving, if any of those cards or counters are still set aside, they are trashed during step 10.3.1f or step 10.3.1g of the next checkpoint, as appropriate. Other abilities cannot interact with these cards or counters while they are set aside (see r ule 4.8.3).**

***Example: The Runner uses the \[trash\] ability on Bookmark. They pay the trigger cost and set all hosted cards aside (preserving their facedown status). When the ability resolves, the Runner adds the previously-hosted cards to the grip as directed.***

***Example: The Runner uses the \[trash\] ability on Street Peddler. They pay the trigger cost and set the 3 hosted cards aside. When the ability resolves, the Runner installs one of the set-aside cards. Since the other two cards are still set aside, the next checkpoint trashes them just as in any other case of cards that were hosted on a card that is no longer installed. No other abilities are able to tell that the cards were set aside: they are treated as having been installed or trashed from their previous location in the play area.***

***Example: This example describes a situation similar to the previous examples, but covers the sequence of steps the game carries out in a higher level of detail. The Corp has priority in a paid ability window, and chooses to trigger the \[trash\] ability on Reconstruction Contract. As they pay the trigger cost, moving Reconstruction Contract to Archives, they set aside the advancement tokens hosted on Reconstruction Contract. Next, a checkpoint occurs following the cost having been paid. After that checkpoint and any corresponding reaction window, the \[trash\] ability’s instruction is ready to become***

&nbsp;

***imminent. The Corp chooses a card they can advance to be the instruction’s target, and an interrupt window opens. After the interrupt window (assuming the effects of the instruction are not prevented), the Corp moves the set-aside tokens to the target card.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Steps of Using a Paid Ability**
         1. **Announce the intent to trigger the paid ability.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Pay the trigger cost. The ability and its source are considered used. “When used” abilities meet their trigger conditions. (The cost-paid checkpoint then occurs.)**
         1. **Announce any targets for the ability’s first instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent.**
         1. **An interrupt window occurs, during which abilities can modify, prevent, or avoid the imminent effects.**
         1. **Resolve the instruction, applying any changes to its effects from interrupts that were resolved.**
         1. **A checkpoint occurs.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If there are more instructions to resolve, announce any targets for the next instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent. Return to (d).**
         1. **Resolution of the paid ability is complete.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Conditional Abilities**
      1. **A CONDITIONAL ABILITY is an ability that a player can or must trigger at a specific point in the game. Conditional abilities always include a primary condition and one or more instructions, but they have no special syntax requirements.**
         1. **The primary condition of a conditional ability is usually a trigger condition, but can also be a static condition.**
         1. **The primary condition of a conditional ability is often, but not always, written at the front of the ability. See rule 9.3.6c for details about conditional ability syntax.**
      1. **When a conditional ability has met its condition, one or more INSTANCES of that conditional ability is created PENDING in the next reaction window that opens. Each instance of a conditional ability is a separate copy of that ability that resolves independently of the others. An instance of an ability with the pending status is waiting for its controller to trigger it.**
      1. **A conditional ability with a static condition can only have one instance at a time.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **A conditional ability with a trigger condition can have multiple instances.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a trigger condition is met again while an instance of the corresponding ability is already pending, imminent, or resolving, a new instance can still become pending in the next reaction window.**
         1. **If the trigger condition of an ability is met more than once between consecutive checkpoints, multiple instances of that ability become pending in the next reaction window.**

***Example: The Runner plays Singularity, trashing 3 Corp cards simultaneously. Since Hostile Infrastructure’s trigger condition is met separately for each card trashed, the next checkpoint handles all of those occurrences, and 3 instances of the ability become pending in the same reaction window.***

***Example: The Runner controls Blackguard and plays Satellite Uplink, exposing 2 cards in a single instruction. In the next checkpoint, two instances of Blackguard’s ability become pending, one corresponding to each card that was exposed.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **The trigger condition of most conditional abilities describes an occurrence that allows it to become pending. These rules about trigger conditions also apply to conditional abilities with static conditions, except as described in section 9.6.7.**
         1. **During each checkpoint, the game checks whether any conditional abilities have met their trigger conditions. If any have, a reaction window opens to resolve those abilities (See section 10.3). This reaction window is fully resolved and closed before the game proceeds to the next instruction of the original effect or game rule.**
         1. **A conditional ability can only recognize its trigger condition occurring if the ability is active at the time the trigger condition resolves. If a conditional ability becomes active after the point when its trigger condition was met, that ability does not become pending, even if other abilities sharing that trigger condition are still pending.**
         1. **A conditional ability can only recognize its trigger condition occurring if all the stipulations and requirements listed in the trigger condition are met at the moment that the trigger condition would occur.**

***Example: The entire trigger condition on Quantum Predictive Model is “If the Runner is tagged when Quantum Predictive Model is accessed”. Quantum Predictive Model can only meet its trigger condition if the Runner is tagged at the time the access occurs. Even if Casting Call is hosted on Quantum Predictive Model, the tag will be given after the access begins, and no ordering of the abilities will allow Quantum Predictive Model to meet its trigger condition.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Additional stipulations and requirements listed in the instructions of a conditional ability are checked as part of the ability’s effects and are not part of the ability’s trigger condition. For the effects under the scope of this kind**

&nbsp;

**of condition to resolve, the condition only needs to be met when the relevant instructions resolve. This can occur even if some or all of those conditions were not met at the time the ability met its trigger condition.**

***Example: If a Runner with 1 link has both Underworld Contact installed and The Supplier installed hosting a Dyson Mem Chip, both Underworld Contact and The Supplier meet their trigger conditions at the same time. The Runner can trigger The Supplier first, installing the Dyson Mem Chip, thus allowing Underworld Contact to recognize that the Runner has 2 link and give them 1 credit, even though the Runner did not have 2 link at the time the Underworld Contact became pending.***

      1. &nbsp;
         1. **The phrase “If successful” in reference to a run is a trigger condition with specific rules. See s ection 6.7.3. The phrases “If successful” and “If unsuccessful” are also frequently used as trigger conditions relating to the results of a trace. See section 10.8.**
      1. **Trigger conditions look for an instantaneous change in the game state. The next checkpoint after that change takes place marks an instance of the ability as pending for each occurrence of the change that was looked for.**
      1. **Conditional abilities with a static condition instead of a trigger condition describe an effect that must be performed repeatedly, if possible, while the condition is true. Such abilities usually attempt to end their own repetition by uninstalling their source.**
         1. **During each checkpoint, the game checks whether any conditional abilities with static conditions should become pending, alongside conditional abilities with trigger conditions. However, there are further requirements for this kind of ability to be marked pending.**
         1. **A conditional ability with a static condition can only be marked pending during a checkpoint if the condition is true at the beginning of that checkpoint.**
         1. **A conditional ability with a static condition can only be marked pending if no other instance of the same ability from the same source is already pending, imminent, or resolving.**
         1. **A conditional ability with a static condition can only be marked pending if the instructions in the ability have the potential to change the game state.**

***Example: Parasite is hosted on a piece of ice with 0 strength. Parasite’s ability tries to trash that ice. If the effect of an interrupt ability prevents the ice from being trashed without increasing its strength, the condition is still true, so the ability will become pending again. But this does not occur while the previous instance of the ability is still pending or resolving. Conversely, if a static ability (such as the one on Architect) prohibits Parasite from trashing the ice, Parasite’s ability does not***

&nbsp;

***have the potential to change the game state, and therefore it does not become pending.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **A player can trigger a conditional ability while they have priority in a reaction window in which the ability is pending.**
         1. **Once a player triggers a conditional ability, that instance of the ability loses its pending status. Other pending instances of the ability are unaffected and can still be triggered later, regardless of whether those instances are associated with the same reaction window.**
         1. **If the \[interrupt\] symbol appears before a conditional ability’s text, that ability is an interrupt. These abilities will become pending in interrupt windows rather than reaction windows, but are otherwise resolved in the same way as non-interrupt conditional abilities. See section 9.8.**
      1. **If a conditional ability gives its controller a choice of whether to apply its effects, such that the ability could potentially have no effects at all, it is considered an OPTIONAL CONDITIONAL ABILITY. These abilities can usually be recognized by the presence of permissive words such as “may” or “allows”, or by a restriction such as “Use this ability only once per turn.” If the ability is not optional, then it is a MANDATORY CONDITIONAL ABILITY.**
         1. **Instances of optional conditional abilities can still be pending when their controller passes in the corresponding priority window. Players are not required to trigger optional conditional abilities.**
         1. **Players must trigger all instances of pending mandatory conditional abilities they control in a given priority window before they can pass in that window. See section 9.2.8.**
         1. **Both optional and mandatory conditional abilities may have optional parts to their effects. Even if triggering the ability is mandatory, its controller may still decline any optional constituent effects that arise during its resolution.**
         1. **A conditional ability and its source are considered used when any optional component of the ability’s effects is carried out.**
      1. **Ice subroutines are mandatory conditional abilities that have special rules for their resolution. See section 6.5 for details.**
      1. **If any instances of a conditional ability are pending and the conditional ability itself becomes inactive, those instances loses their pending status and will not resolve.**

***Example: The Runner has both Aesop’s Pawnshop and Drug Dealer installed. Both cards have abilities that meet their trigger conditions when the Runner’s turn begins. If the Runner chooses to trigger Aesop’s Pawnshop first, and then uses it to trash Drug Dealer, Drug Dealer’s pending ability can never be triggered, so the Runner does not lose a credit.***

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **If a priority window closes while any abilities still have pending instances associated with that window, the remaining instances lose their pending status and cannot be triggered or resolved. See rule 9.2.8f.**
      1. **Once a player triggers a conditional ability and its instructions become imminent, the ability becomes independent of its source and rule 9.1.12 applies to it.**
      1. **A DELAYED CONDITIONAL ABILITY is a conditional ability maintained by a lingering effect (see section 9.9). Unlike other lingering effects, some delayed conditional abilities are created without an explicitly stated duration. If this is the case, the ability exists until the next time it resolves. If an instruction creates a delayed conditional ability and does specify a duration, that duration applies normally.**

***Example: Joshua B’s ability allows the Runner to gain \[click\]. If they do, it creates a delayed conditional ability that is independent of Joshua B itself, which will meet its trigger condition only once, when that turn ends. After that ability resolves, the game no longer maintains the lingering effect creating the ability.***

***Example: In the Groove creates a delayed conditional ability that specifies a duration of “this turn”. Since a duration is specified, it is not limited to only being triggered once. The ability becomes pending and can resolve every time its trigger condition is met, and its existence only expires at the end of the turn.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Steps of Triggering and Resolving a Conditional Ability**
         1. **Announce that you will trigger one of the pending abilities associated with the reaction window that gave you priority.**
         1. **Announce any targets for the ability’s first instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent.**
         1. **An interrupt window occurs, during which abilities can modify, prevent, or avoid the imminent effects.**
         1. **Resolve the instruction, applying any changes to its effects from interrupts that were resolved. If the controller of the ability chooses to resolve an optional effect contained in this instruction, and this is the first instruction for which that player has done so, “when used” conditionals meet their trigger conditions.**
         1. **A checkpoint occurs.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If there are more instructions to resolve, announce any targets for the next instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent. Return to (c).**
         1. **Resolution of the conditional ability is complete.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Play Abilities**
      1. **Any ability on an event or operation that is not a paid, conditional, or static ability is a PLAY ABILITY. Play abilities are the abilities that resolve as part of playing that event or operation during step 8.6.6.**

***Example: The operation card Hyoubu Precog Manifold has several abilities of different types. The first sentence reads “Play only if there is no active lockdown.” This is a static ability that contains a restriction and no declarations. The second sentence (“This operation is not trashed until your next turn begins.”) is a play ability that has no immediate impact on the game state but creates a lingering effect that alters how the operation will leave the play area after resolving. The second paragraph reads simply, “Choose a server.” This play ability instruction is the main part of the card that actively affects the game state while the operation resolves. Finally, the third paragraph is a single conditional ability with multiple instructions that is active as long as the operation remains in the play area.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Steps of Resolving a Play Ability**
         1. **Announce any targets for the ability’s first instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent.**
         1. **An interrupt window occurs, during which abilities can modify, prevent, or avoid the imminent effects.**
         1. **Resolve the instruction, applying any changes to its effects from interrupts that were resolved.**
         1. **A checkpoint occurs.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If there are more instructions to resolve, announce any targets for the next instruction. That instruction then becomes imminent. Return to (b).**
         1. **Resolution of the play ability is complete.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Interrupts and Replacement Effects**
      1. **An INTERRUPT is an ability that modifies either the effects of another instruction or the context in which that instruction will be resolved. Interrupts can be written in the form of a paid ability or a conditional ability.**
         1. **Interrupt abilities are denoted by the \[interrupt\] symbol appearing at the beginning of the ability, or by certain keywords in the ability’s text.**
         1. **Any paid or conditional ability that uses the word “prevent” or “avoid” is an interrupt ability.**
      1. **The EXPECTED EFFECTS of an imminent instruction are the effects described by the instruction’s text, modified by any static abilities that affect it and any**

&nbsp;

**replacement effects or interrupt effects that have been applied. The expected effects of an instruction are continually updated throughout the interrupt window.**

***Example: The Runner plays Process Automation and the instruction “Gain 2\[c\] and draw 1 card.” becomes imminent. The expected effects of this instruction are that the Runner will gain 2\[c\] and draw 1 card.***

***Example: The Runner plays Process Automation after Lockdown’s subroutine resolves. The instruction “Gain 2\[c\] and draw 1 card.” becomes imminent, but the Runner cannot draw cards. The expected effect of this instruction is that the Runner will gain 2\[c\].***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **When an instruction resolves, its expected effects correspond to the effects that occur, except for situations where rule 9.8.7b applies.**
      1. **In order to trigger an interrupt, it must be RELEVANT to an imminent instruction. An interrupt is relevant to an instruction if at least one of the following is true:**
         1. **Its effects could prevent or avoid part or all of the imminent instruction’s expected effects. See section 9.8.5.**
         1. **Its effects could modify a value associated with the imminent instruction’s expected effects. See section 9.8.6 and section 9.8.7.**
         1. **Its effects could create a replacement effect that applies to the imminent instruction’s expected effects. See rule 9.8.10.**
         1. **It has a trigger condition using the word “would” that is met by the imminent instruction’s expected effects.**

***Example: The trigger condition on The Class Act’s second ability is “The first time each turn you would draw any number of cards”. Even though this ability’s effects do not directly modify the imminent instruction’s effects, the ability is relevant to an instruction that is expected to draw cards.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Whenever an instruction becomes imminent, an interrupt window opens to allow players to modify the effects of that instruction. Section 9.2.9 contains the rules for handling priority during interrupt windows.**
         1. **As the window opens, the initial expected effects of the instruction are determined, then any active replacement effects that replace all or part of the expected effects are applied. If multiple replacement effects could apply, the order in which they are applied follows the rules in section 9.8.11.**
         1. **After replacement effects have been applied, but before players receive priority, active conditional ability interrupts that are relevant to the imminent instruction are marked pending and are associated with the window. If a conditional ability interrupt becomes active after the interrupt window opens, it does not become pending.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **While a player has priority in an interrupt window, they can trigger a conditional ability interrupt they control only if it is pending in that window and still relevant to the imminent instruction.**

***Example: An instruction is imminent that would trash an installed copy of Harbinger. The Runner uses Sacrificial Construct to prevent Harbinger from being trashed. The Runner can no longer trigger Harbinger’s interrupt ability, even though it is still pending, because the expected effects of the instruction no longer include Harbinger being trashed and therefore the ability is no longer relevant.***

***Example: An instruction is imminent that would give the Runner 2 tags. The Runner trashes Decoy to use its ability to avoid 1 of the tags, which meets the trigger condition for Thunder Art Gallery’s ability. The latter resolves as a chain reaction (see rule 9.1.2a) while the interrupt window is still open, allowing the Runner to install No One Home, which has a conditional ability interrupt that is relevant since the instruction is still expected to give the Runner 1 tag. However, No One Home was not active when the interrupt window opened, so its ability is not pending and cannot be triggered.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **While a player has priority in an interrupt window, they can use a paid ability interrupt that is relevant to the imminent instruction. The ability does not have to have been active when the interrupt window opened, nor does a paid ability window need to be open at this time.**

***Example: An instruction is imminent that would give the Runner 2 tags. The Runner trashes Decoy to use its ability to avoid 1 of the tags, which meets the trigger condition for Thunder Art Gallery’s ability. The latter resolves as a chain reaction (see rule 9.1.2a) while the interrupt window is still open, allowing the Runner to install another copy of Decoy. The Runner receives priority again in the original interrupt window and uses the second Decoy’s ability to avoid the other imminent tag.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **To PREVENT or AVOID an effect is to stop that effect from happening. The terms “prevent” and “avoid” are synonymous.**
         1. **Some abilities look for an ordinal instance of an effect that “would” take place within a specified time period. These abilities look for the appropriate number of times that effect becomes imminent, not whether the effect actually resolves. Preventing or replacing an effect does not allow these abilities to meet their trigger conditions again in the same time period.**

***Example: Tori Hanzō’s interrupt can only be used “the first time you would do net damage” during a run. If the first net damage that becomes imminent is prevented by the Runner using Feedback Filter, Tori Hanzō cannot be used on any other instances of net damage for the remainder of the run, as the next imminent net damage is the second time the Corp “would” deal net damage, not the first time.***

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Abilities that do not use “would” do not see effects that are prevented, as those effects did not occur.**
         1. **A static ability can stipulate that a particular effect is always prevented. This kind of prevention effect does not require a player to explicitly trigger it.**

***Example: Paparazzi reads in part, “Prevent all meat damage.” This is a static ability that applies automatically to any instruction that would deal meat damage.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Some instructions make use of an associated value. These values can be changed by interrupts and replacement effects.**
         1. **A number of tags the Runner would take from an effect is a value. Avoiding a number of those tags decreases that value. The value for a number of tags the Runner takes must be greater than 0 for the effect giving tags to occur.**
         1. **An amount of damage the Runner would take from an effect is a value. Preventing an amount of that damage decreases that value. The value for an amount of damage the Runner takes must be greater than 0 for the damage effect to occur.**
         1. **A cost that would be paid while resolving an effect is a value. Rule 1.15.1c applies to the final value at the time the cost is paid. See also rule 1.15.1d.**

***Example: Patchwork’s interrupt modifies a play cost or install cost, so it is relevant to any instruction where a card will be played or installed and the corresponding cost paid.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **The base trace strength of a trace attempt is a value. See s ection 10.8 for rules about trace attempts. A base trace strength value does not need to be greater than 0 for the trace attempt to occur.**
      1. **Values associated with an imminent instruction are calculated continuously as part of the instruction’s expected effects.**
         1. **While an instruction is imminent, values associated with that instruction can be reduced below 0. Values 0 or lower can still be modified by other interrupt abilities while the instruction remains imminent.**

***Example: The Runner takes a tag on their turn, allowing the Corp to trigger Mr. Stone. While the 1 meat damage from Mr. Stone’s ability is imminent, both players can trigger interrupts to modify the damage effect. Since it is the Runner’s turn, they receive priority first and use Biometric Spoofing to prevent 2 damage. The imminent effect is now expected to do -1 damage. When the Corp receives priority, they trigger two copies of The Cleaners that each add 1 to the expected damage, increasing the total to 0 and then to 1. The ability will resolve with 1 damage even though the amount of damage was temporarily 0 or less while the effect was imminent.***

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If an effect prevents “all damage” or “any amount of damage” while an instruction is imminent, the damage is removed from the expected effects entirely, and there is no longer a value to be modified. If an effect avoids “all tags” or “any number of tags” while an instruction is imminent, taking tags is removed from the expected effects entirely, and there is no longer a value to be modified.**
         1. **One card, *Bio-Modeled Network*, has an instruction that prevents “all but 1 net damage.” This ability is relevant when the imminent instruction’s expected effects include doing net damage and the amount of the damage is 2 or more. The effect of this ability is to set the value for the amount of damage to 1. Previously-applied modifiers to the value are ignored. The value can still be modified by other interrupts after being set to 1 this way.**
         1. **Some types of values must be greater than 0 for the associated effect to occur. See section 9.8.6. At the time an instruction resolves, if any value of one of those types is 0 or less, as much of that ability resolves as possible without applying the part of the effect making use of that value, following rules 1.2.3 and 1 .2.4 of the Golden Rules.**

***Example: The Runner accesses Breached Dome. While the instruction from its “when accessed” ability is imminent, the Runner uses Biometric Spoofing to prevent 2 damage. When the ability resolves, the value for the amount of damage is -1, which is less than or equal to 0, so the damage effect cannot occur and the Corp only trashes the top card of the stack.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Any effects making use of modified values maintain their restrictions and specifications with the new values.**

***Example: While the result of a successful trace from Flare is imminent, the Corp triggers The Cleaners to increase the imminent meat damage by 1. Even though the damage from Flare has been increased from 2 to 3, none of that meat damage can be prevented.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **A REPLACEMENT EFFECT modifies another effect by replacing some or all of the original effect’s behavior with different behavior. Replacement effects are indicated by the word “instead” in their text. Once created, replacement effects apply automatically and do not require players to explicitly trigger them.**
         1. **Interrupts can introduce replacement effects that apply to the currently imminent instruction. See rule 9.8.10.**
         1. **Static abilities can stipulate replacement effects that apply whenever appropriate while the static ability is active.**
         1. **Other abilities can create replacement effects ahead of time, which apply to effects that could happen later. This is a type of lingering effect (see section 9**&nbsp; **.9).**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Replacement effects most commonly apply to the effects of an instruction, but some apply to static abilities or alter the durations of lingering effects.**
         1. **If a replacement effect modifies the effects of a static ability or the duration of a lingering effect, this modification applies continuously for as long as the replacement effect itself is active, and no longer applies once the replacement effect or the original effect being modified becomes inactive.**

***Example: Gebrselassie’s static ability replaces the durations of certain lingering effects affecting its host with a duration of “for the remainder of the turn.” If Gebrselassie is uninstalled or moved to a different host, its replacement effect no longer applies to those lingering effects, so they revert to their normal durations. If any of those durations have already expired, the corresponding effects will end at the next checkpoint.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If an active replacement effect can apply to the expected effects of an imminent instruction, it is applied as the interrupt window opens, and the expected effects of the instruction are updated accordingly. This happens before the expected effects are checked for relevant active abilities that could become pending. Replacement effects created by interrupts will not yet be active at this time and are applied according to rule 9.8.10 instead.**
         1. **Each replacement effect can only apply once to any single effect. Once a replacement effect has been applied, even if the new effect it creates (or a new effect created by a later replacement effect) still includes an occurrence of the effect that gets replaced, the same replacement effect cannot be applied to that effect again.**

***Example: The Runner accesses Project Vacheron and its interrupt ability resolves. The interrupt creates a replacement effect that will override adding the agenda to the Runner’s score area. The Runner will still steal Project Vacheron, but they will do so by adding it to their score area with hosted agenda counters. Even though the modified effect still includes adding Project Vacheron to the Runner’s score area, there is no way for the replacement effect to apply again to its own results.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **Some interrupts create replacement effects to modify an instruction that is already imminent. When the interrupt resolves, if the replacement effect can apply to the expected effects of the imminent instruction, it is applied immediately.**

***Example: An instruction is imminent with an expected effect of the Corp doing net damage to the Runner. The Corp uses Tori Hanzō’s ability, creating a replacement effect replacing net damage with brain damage. The replacement effect applies immediately, so after Tori Hanzō’s ability resolves, the expected effect is now to do 1 brain damage. When players get priority again, their interrupts are relevant or not based on the new expected effects.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **If multiple replacement effects would apply to an effect acting on a targeted card, that card’s controller chooses the order in which the replacement effects apply. If**

&nbsp;

**multiple replacement effects would apply to any other effect, the controller of the base effect chooses the order in which the replacement effects apply.**

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **After applying one replacement effect, a subsequent replacement effect can only be applied if the effect it was to replace is still expected. A replacement effect cannot apply without something to replace.**

***Example: The Runner chooses HQ with Security Testing when their turn begins, then plays Account Siphon. When the run becomes successful, both Security Testing and Account Siphon create replacement effects. When step 6.9.5g of the run becomes imminent, the Runner must choose to apply either the replacement effect from Security Testing or the one from Account Siphon. Since neither effect creates a new instance of accessing cards, the effect not chosen to apply first has nothing to replace and does not apply.***

***Example: The Runner chooses R\&D with Security Testing when their turn begins, then plays Showing Off. When a run on R\&D becomes successful, both Security Testing and Showing Off create replacement effects. When step 6.9.5g of the run becomes imminent, the Runner must choose to apply either the replacement effect from Security Testing or the one from Showing Off. If they choose to apply Security Testing first, Showing Off’s effect has nothing to replace and does not apply. If they choose to apply Showing Off first, the expected effects still include accessing cards from R\&D, albeit not in the usual way. Security Testing can still replace this access, so it applies next. Either way, the Runner will gain 2\[c\] and will not access any cards.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Lingering Effects**
      1. **Instructions can create LINGERING EFFECTS that exist beyond their resolution. Once a lingering effect is created, it exists independently of its source even if the source becomes inactive. Lingering effects persist only for the duration specified in the instruction that created them.**
      1. **Some lingering effects exist only to maintain the existence of another ability. Delayed conditional abilities are maintained this way and are the only case where the duration of a lingering effect may be implicit. See rule 9.6.14.**
      1. **If a lingering effect is created with a duration based on a timing structure that is not in progress at the time the lingering effect is created, the duration expires immediately, and the lingering effect persists only until the next checkpoint after it is created.**
         1. **Abilities on an icebreaker that modify their source’s strength have an implicit duration of “for the remainder of the current encounter”. See rule 3.9.5b.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. **Identifying Instructions**

***To correctly resolve conditional abilities and interrupts that could meet their trigger conditions during the resolution of another ability (see rule 9.1.2a), players need to determine where checkpoints occur during the resolution of each ability. This section aids players in making this determination. For clarifications on particular cards, refer to the Release Notes for the set in which that card appears or to the Rulings section of that card's page on [netrunnerdb.com***](<https://netrunnerdb.com/>)***.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **An instruction normally cannot be paused once it begins to resolve. An instruction can only be paused if a checkpoint opens in the middle of its resolution, which only occurs in the following cases:**
         1. **Any time a cost is paid, a checkpoint must occur immediately afterward.**

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **When a timing structure is opened, the specified checkpoints in that timing structure are carried out. See section 9.2.2 for a list of timing structures.**
         1. **When an event or operation is played, the checkpoints specified in section 8 .6 are carried out.**
         1. **When a trace is initiated, the checkpoints specified in section 10.8.6 are carried out.**
      1. **Each step in a game rule or timing structure forms a single instruction. When executing timing steps, the game pauses for checkpoints only where checkpoints are specified within the rules and timing structures.**
      1. **Usually, each sentence in the text of an ability forms a single instruction. After each instruction, an ability pauses its resolution to allow priority windows to open and other abilities to resolve. First, a checkpoint occurs, allowing any appropriate conditional abilities to be marked as pending in a reaction window, then targets are announced for the next instruction. Finally, the next instruction becomes imminent, allowing interrupts relevant to that instruction to resolve in an interrupt window.**
      1. **Some sentences are not instructions, some sentences encompass multiple instructions, and some instructions encompass multiple sentences. These are the cases in which sentences do not correspond one-to-one with instructions:**
         1. **A sentence is not part of any instruction if it only provides clarification, restrictions or conditions on when or how the ability it appears in can be triggered, or otherwise does not give directions to the players or the game state that would be carried out as the ability resolves.**

***Example: A sentence reading "Use this ability only by spending credits from a stealth card." is not an instruction or part of any instruction. It is a restriction that applies to the entire ability.***

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a sentence directs a player to play or install more than one card, each such card is handled as a separate instruction. The instruction ends and a new one begins immediately before each play or install after the first.**

***Example: The Corp plays Shipment from MirrorMorph, which has a single sentence directing them to install up to 3 cards from HQ. This is treated as though it said, “You may install a card from HQ. You may install a card from HQ. You may install a card from HQ.”, or equivalently, “You may install a card from HQ. Repeat this process 2 more times.”***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a sentence directs a player to choose 1 or more targets, but does not act on that choice or describe any other effects, that sentence and the following sentence form a single instruction.**

***Example: Tinkering’s play ability reads, “Choose a piece of ice. That ice gains sentry, code gate, and barrier until the end of the turn.” The first sentence does nothing except direct the Runner to select a target, so it forms a single instruction with the second sentence. The target is chosen as the instruction becomes imminent, and the card gains the subtypes when the instruction resolves.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Some older cards have search effects written in the same sentence as the effects that will be performed upon any found cards. Treat these sentences as if ending the search and performing any necessary shuffling is the end of an instruction. A checkpoint occurs while cards found by the search are in the set-aside zone, then the remainder of the sentence is treated as the next instruction.**

***Example: The Runner uses Djinn to search for a program while the Corp has Personality Profiles in their score area. The Runner finds and sets aside a copy of Datasucker and shuffles the stack. This ends an instruction, and since the search has occurred, Personality Profiles’s ability meets its trigger condition. The Corp resolves the ability during a reaction window before the next instruction becomes imminent, forcing the Runner to trash a random card from their grip. Finally, the second instruction resolves and the Runner adds the set-aside Datasucker to their grip.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Some older cards direct a player to look at or reveal a set of cards in the same sentence as the effects that will be performed upon those cards. Treat these sentences as if making the cards visible to the relevant player(s) is the end of an instruction. A checkpoint occurs once the cards are visible to the relevant player(s), then the remainder of the sentence is treated as the next instruction.**

***Example: The Corp is resolving the first subroutine on Architect, which, in one sentence, allows the Corp to look at cards in R\&D and install one of them. Looking at the top 5 cards of R\&D ends the ability’s first instruction. Once the Corp is able to see those cards, they can choose a target for the second instruction, which will install it. Since the install is optional, the Corp can also decline to choose a target,***

&nbsp;

***and the second instruction will have no effect. After the second instruction resolves, the ability is complete, and the Corp’s permission to look at cards in R\&D ends.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If an effect directs a player to choose between a set of options that would create different effects, that choice ends an instruction. Each option begins its own instruction or set of instructions, and the one chosen will resolve next.**

***Example: The Runner encounters Data Raven and is forced by its first ability to resolve either “take 1 tag” or “end the run.” Making this choice ends the first instruction, and the option the Runner chooses will become imminent after a checkpoint.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **If an ability initiates a timing structure, its source may have linked abilities that apply during that timing structure. These are frequently written directly after the instruction that creates the timing structure, but they are not instructions in the same ability.**
   1. **Other Rules and Terminology**
      1. **Simultaneous Effects**
         1. **If more than one effect attempts to modify the same value, determine its final value from its default value by first applying any effect that sets it to a specific value, then applying each effect that increases the value, and finally applying each effect that lowers the value.**
         1. **If more than one effect attempts to add or remove the same subtype from a card, count the number of times the subtype is added (including from the card’s printed text) and the number of times the subtype is removed. As long as the number of times added is greater, the card has that subtype. As long as the number of times removed is greater or the numbers are equal, the card does not have that subtype.**
         1. **If more than one effect gives a player a choice of how to resolve an ability or game rule such that both players are instructed to make a choice that can only be made once, the active player makes that choice. The effects that granted the players the choice otherwise resolve as normal.**

***Example: If Chronos Protocol and Titanium Ribs are both active, both players are instructed to choose the card trashed by the first net damage each turn. Since this is impossible, only the active player chooses that card. Since Chronos Protocol also instructs the Corp to look at the Runner’s grip and this is not prevented or contradicted by any other ability, this part of the effect happens on either player’s turn.***

      1. **Acting on Sets of Cards**
         1. **If an effect acts on a set of cards for a single purpose, then the effect acts on all of those cards together simultaneously rather than one at a time.**

***Example: The Runner uses Singularity to simultaneously trash a rezzed Warroid Tracker and a rezzed Hostile Infrastructure. Hostile Infrastructure has a trigger condition of “Whenever the Runner trashes a Corp card”, so it sees both trashed cards and becomes pending twice. By contrast, Warroid Tracker has a trigger condition of “Whenever the Runner trashes 1 or more cards in or protecting this server,” so it sees only a single event that trashed multiple cards. Warroid Tracker’s ability becomes pending only once.***

      1. &nbsp;
         1. **When the resolution of an ability involves an effect repeated “for each” of some quantity, the full effect of the ability is first calculated, and then the ability resolves. If the ability would resolve on an empty set or a value of 0, then nothing is counted and thus the effect does not resolve.**

***Example: The Runner encounters a Cortex Lock and does not break the subroutine. If the Runner has 2 unused MU, both of the net damage can be prevented with Biometric Spoofing because Cortex Lock does a single instance of 2 net damage, not 2 instances of 1 net damage each. If the Runner has no unused MU, then no net damage is dealt because there is no MU to count.***

      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a condition refers to “all” items in a set and that set contains zero items, the condition is automatically satisfied as soon as it would be satisfied for one or more of that item.**

***Example: The Runner plays Forked, initiating a run on a server. The first piece of ice that the Runner encounters is Troll. If Troll’s “when encountered” ability does not end the run, the Runner is automatically considered to have broken all of the zero subroutines on Troll as soon as step 6.9.3b of the encounter begins, and Troll is trashed by Forked.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **“Must”**
         1. **If a card ability states that a player “must” do something without stipulating how that player must do so, then that player is forced to make any decisions necessary to satisfy the requirement, even if it requires the use of other card abilities.**

***Example: The Runner has an Imp and a Scrubber installed and accesses Mumbad Virtual Tour. If the Runner only has 4\[c\], they must still choose to either spend a counter from Imp to trash Mumbad Virtual Tour if they are able to do so or spend recurring credits on Scrubber to help pay the trash cost of the Mumbad Virtual Tour.***

   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If a card ability states that a player “must” do something and specifies the means by which that player must do so, then that player is not required to carry out the effect except by the means specified, even if it would be possible through the use of other card abilities.**

***Example: The Runner has Imp and Neutralize All Threats installed when they access a card with a trash cost greater than the number of credits they have available to spend. Because they are unable to trash the card by paying its trash cost, they are not required to spend a counter from Imp in order to trash it.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **If the “must” ability presents a player with a choice between two or more effects, that player must choose an effect that can be fully resolved. If none of the choices can be fully resolved, then the “must” ability does nothing.**

***Example: If the first subroutine on Fairchild 2.0 resolves while the Runner has no installed cards but 3\[c\], then the Runner must choose to pay 2\[c\]. When the second subroutine on Fairchild 2.0 resolves, the Runner can neither pay 2\[c\] nor trash an installed card, so nothing happens.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **Making a choice between effects is always a separate instruction from resolving the chosen effect (see rule 9.10.4f). The previous rule only requires the player to choose an effect that is possible to resolve; it does not require the chosen effect to actually resolve as expected. Once an effect has been chosen, the player can apply interrupts to modify, prevent, or replace that effect as normal.**

***Example: If the Runner encounters Data Raven, they must choose to either take a tag or end the run. The Runner can choose to take the tag, then avoid the tag with Decoy. This does not cause the run to end, as the decision to take the tag has already been made.***

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. **A singular “must” ability cannot force a player to pay an additional cost they wish to decline, but a player cannot avoid choosing a fully resolvable effect from among multiple options in a “must” ability by declining to pay the additional cost for one of those choices.**

***Example: If Service Outage is active and the Runner has Always Be Running installed, the Runner can decline to pay the additional 1\[c\] to make a run with their first \[click\], thus satisfying the “must” of Always Be Running and allowing them to spend their first click on a different action. However, if a Runner plays a Forged Activation Orders on an unrezzed Archer, the Corporation cannot choose to rez the Archer but decline to forfeit an agenda; the Corp must either pay 4\[c\] and forfeit an agenda to rez the Archer or trash the Archer.***

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. **“Repeat this process”**
         1. **If an ability instructs a player to “repeat this process” without specifying how many times to do so, then that player resolves the ability again, including the instruction to “repeat this process” if it is still applicable.**
         1. **If an ability instructs a player to "repeat this process" a specified number of times, then that player resolves the entire ability, except for the repetition instruction, that many times in a row. The number of repetitions is determined after the first full resolution but before the first repetition, and once the number of repetitions is determined it cannot be changed.**
         1. **Regardless of the number of times an ability is repeated, a checkpoint occurs after each full resolution of the ability’s instructions, before another repetition begins.**
         1. **Each repetition of the ability is resolved independently of the others. If the ability provides the player with any choices, they may choose differently each time.**

&nbsp;

1. Additional Rules
   1. General
      1. To PURGE VIRUS COUNTERS is to remove all virus counters hosted on cards and return them to the bank. **The Corp can purge virus counters as a basic action or with a card ability.**
         1. The Corp can always use a purge effect, even if there are no virus counters currently hosted on any cards. This is an exception to rule 1.2.5.
      1. Some card abilities require the Corp or Runner to FORFEIT an agenda. To forfeit an agenda means to remove from the game an agenda in that player’s score area. The player no longer scores points for the forfeited agenda. All cards hosted on that agenda are trashed and all tokens that are hosted on that agenda are returned to the bank. This is unpreventable and occurs during the next checkpoint. See section 10.3.
      1. Some abilities add a card to a player’s score area “as an agenda”. When this happens, the card loses all its previous properties and gains only those properties specified in the effect converting it. This conversion lasts until the card moves to a zone that is not a score area, at which point it returns to being its original printed card. If this happens in any way other than by agenda forfeit, the card is immediately trashed. See rule 10.1.2#8202;**.**
      1. Some abilities can convert a card into a counter. When this happens, the card loses all its previous properties and gains only those properties specified in the effect converting it. This conversion lasts until the counter moves to another zone, at which point it reverts to being a card, regains its original printed characteristics, and is trashed.
