         1. ARCHIVES is the name for the Corp’s discard pile. It is also one of the Corp’s central servers. See section 4.7.7.
         1. Cards in Archives can be either faceup or facedown. If a Corp card is visible to the Runner when it is trashed or discarded, it is put in Archives faceup. If a Corp card is not visible to the Runner when it is trashed or discarded, then it is put in Archives facedown. Facedown cards in Archives should be oriented horizontally so that the Runner can easily see they are present.
         1. The faceup cards in Archives are open information. Any player may look through the faceup cards in Archives at any time. The facedown cards in Archives are visible only to the Corp. The Corp may look through the facedown cards in Archives at any time, but the Runner cannot look at them.
