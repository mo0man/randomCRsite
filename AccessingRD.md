# Accessing R&D

1. &nbsp;

      1. When the Runner accesses R\&D, they begin with the top card of R\&D and proceed down. Cards accessed from R\&D must be accessed in this order.
         1. If the root of R\&D is being accessed, the Runner may access upgrades in the root of R\&D anywhere in this process, including between accessing cards from R\&D. Only the cards in R\&D itself have their order of access constrained, and only relative to each other.
         1. Players must return accessed cards to R\&D in the same order they were in before.

         1. If the order of R\&D is changed during an access, the Runner continues accessing cards from R\&D as normal, starting with whatever card is now on top of R\&D, and proceeding down through as many cards as they have accesses remaining.

*Example: The Runner **plays The Makerâ€™s Eye and accesses cards from R\&D**. The second card that the Runner accesses is Bacterial Programming. They steal it, allowing the Corp to rearrange, draw, and trash the top 7 cards of R\&D (including the first card that the Runner accessed). Once the Corp has finished this process, the Runner then accesses their final card, starting with the topmost card of R\&D.*

      1. A card being accessed from R\&D is not visible to the Corp unless an ability states that the Runner must reveal that card if it is accessed from R\&D. If this applies, the card remains revealed until it is no longer being accessed. See also rule 1.20.7.
      1. By default, the Runner accesses 1 card from R\&D (the top card of R\&D).
