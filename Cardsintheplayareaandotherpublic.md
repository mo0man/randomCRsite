# Cards in the play area and other public zones are either FACEUP or FACEDOWN. Faceup cards are freely visible to all players. Facedown cards are oriented so that the face containing the card’s information is not visible.

         1. **Cards in hidden or secret zones (see section 4.1) are neither faceup nor facedown.**
      1. **When a player LOOKS at a card, they are allowed to see the front face of the card even if the front face would not normally be visible to them. A player should look at that card without showing it to the other player if it is not normally visible to that player. A player may look at facedown cards they control at any time.**
      1. **To REVEAL a card is to show its front face to all players, then return it to its previous state.**
      1. **Some abilities instruct the Runner to EXPOSE one or more cards. To expose a card is to reveal it, except that only installed, unrezzed cards can be exposed.**
      1. **Effects that instruct a player to look at, reveal, expose, or access a card are not the same, even if they would be performed similarly at times. See section 7 for more information on accessing.**

      1. **If a resolving ability directs one or both players to look at or reveal a card or set of cards, each such card remains visible to the relevant player(s) until the entire ability is finished resolving or the card moves to a different location.**
      1. **The ability “While the Runner is accessing this card from R\&D, they must reveal it.” is a static ability that applies for the entire duration of the access. This is also the case for cards with the older wording, “If \[this card\] is accessed from R\&D, the Runner must reveal it.”**

1. Parts of a Card
   1. Name
      1. The identifier of a card is its NAME, alternatively referred to as its title. It is written along the top of the card for identities, agendas, ice, operations, events, and resources, or immediately below the art box in the case of assets, upgrades, hardware, and programs.
      1. Identities have a subtitle written immediately below the main title line. Their full name is the combination of their main title and subtitle.
      1. When a card refers to its own name, it is a self-reference. See section 10.12.

   1. &nbsp;
      1. When a card refers to “copies of” cards with a particular name, it refers to any card with that name.
   1. Unique Symbol
      1. Some cards are UNIQUE, and have a unique symbol (◆) before their name to designate this. There can be only one unique card of the same name active at a time. If a card with a unique name becomes active, any other card that shares its name is unpreventably trashed during the next checkpoint. See section 10.3.
