# Clicks

*Working a job, making connections, and especially jacking in—everything you do takes time, and it always goes by faster than you think. A click represents an abstract amount of time spent on a particular activity, either several hours all at once or scattered across the day.*

      1. A CLICK (\[click\]) is the basic unit of activity. Players spend their clicks to perform actions and trigger abilities. Each click token represents 1 click.
      1. As the first step of a player’s turn, they gain an allotted number of clicks to spend during the action phase of that turn. See s ection 5 for details about the procedures of player turns.

      1. Some cards have the subtype **priority** and the text, “Play only as your first \[click\].” A player can only play a **priority** card using the basic action to play an event or operation, and only if they have not spent any other clicks that turn. Losing clicks does not affect a player’s ability to play a **priority** card.
