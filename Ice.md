*Ice are sophisticated security systems that protect Corporate servers through a variety of means. “Ice” has been suggested to stand for a variety of expressions, but is most commonly expanded as “Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics”.*

      1. Ice are the only type of card installed protecting servers. Ice are not installed in servers. See section 4.7.9.
         1. Ice protecting a server are laid out horizontally in front of that server, with the outermost piece of ice furthest from the server.
         1. When the Corp installs a piece of ice, they must install it in the outermost position protecting a server. See section 8.2.
      1. Ice are among the card types that have rez costs. They are installed unrezzed and remain inactive until the Corp rezzes them by paying their rez costs. See section 8.
         1. Unlike assets and upgrades, ice can normally only be rezzed while being approached during a run. See section 6.4.
      1. Ice are among the card types that have strength. An ice’s strength determines which icebreakers are allowed to interact with it. See section 3.9.5.
      1. Some ice have trash costs. If the Runner accesses an ice with a trash cost, they may pay the trash cost to trash that ice. See section 7.7.
         1. Unlike assets, upgrades, and agendas, ice are not normally accessed while installed. Encountering a piece of ice does not entail accessing that ice and does not give the Runner an opportunity to pay its trash cost.
      1. Ice are the only Corp cards with install costs. The install cost of a piece of ice is not a printed value but instead a calculated value based on the number of other ice already protecting the relevant server. See rule 1.15.5.
      1. Ice are the only cards with subroutines. A piece of ice may have any number of subroutines in its text box, each one indicated by the \[sub\] symbol.
         1. A subroutine on a piece of ice is a required conditional ability that resolves while that ice is being encountered, usually during a run. See rule 6.5.5.
         1. Before the subroutines on a piece of ice resolve during an encounter, the Runner has the opportunity to break them. A broken subroutine does not resolve. See rule 6 .5.4.
