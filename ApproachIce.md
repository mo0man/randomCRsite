# Approach Ice

1. &nbsp;

      1. In the APPROACH ICE PHASE, the Runner makes contact with a piece of ice and decides whether or not to continue the run. The Runner must continue the run if this is the first time they have approached a piece of ice this run. If the Runner continues, the Corp has the opportunity to rez that ice, which will lead to the Runner encountering it.
      1. To APPROACH a piece of ice is to move the current timing point of the run to the beginning of the Approach Ice phase at the position that ice occupies.
         1. If an ability directs the Runner to approach a piece of ice, their position moves to that iceâ€™s position regardless of the normal progression of the run.

         1. If the Runner is directed to approach a piece of ice protecting a server other than the attacked server, the new server becomes the attacked server.
      1. The paid ability window in step 6.9.2e of the Approach Ice Phase is the only time the Corp can normally rez ice. In this window, the Corp only gains the ability to rez the piece of ice being approached, not any other ice.
      1. If the approached piece of ice is rezzed at the end of the Approach Ice Phase, then the Runner encounters it next. See the Encounter Ice Phase, section 6.5.
      1. If the approached piece of ice is unrezzed at the end of the Approach Ice Phase, then the Runner passes it next. See the Pass Ice Phase, s ection 6.6.
