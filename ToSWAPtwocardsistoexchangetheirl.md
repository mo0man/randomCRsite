# To SWAP two cards is to exchange their locations.

      1. A card can only ever be swapped into a location it is normally allowed to occupy. When a player resolves a swap effect, they must observe any applicable game rules or card abilities that would affect that card in its final destination. If a swap effect would resolve while there are no legal exchanges possible, then that effect does nothing.

&nbsp;

*Example: When the subroutine on Metamorph resolves, the Corp cannot choose to swap an agenda and an upgrade such that the agenda would end up in the same remote server as an asset.*

      1. If two installed cards are swapped, each card moves to the other’s location simultaneously. The two cards remain installed throughout the process of swapping, and do not otherwise affect any other part of the game state.
      1. If two cards are swapped between zones, each card moves to the zone the other is in simultaneously.
         1. Each of the swapped cards enters its destination zone in the same state that a card would normally enter that zone. A card swapped into Archives enters Archives facedown **unless it was visible to the Runner at the time of the swap**, a Corp card swapped into the play area enters unrezzed, etc.
         1. If only one of the cards to be swapped is installed, then it becomes uninstalled as it moves to the destination zone. Any cards or counters hosted on it are trashed. The other card becomes installed in the exact position the first card occupied, maintaining any specific location (such as server, ice position, or host).
         1. If two agendas are swapped between the players’ score areas, any hosted cards or counters remain hosted on their respective host agendas.
