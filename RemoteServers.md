         1. Agendas, assets, and upgrades can be installed in REMOTE SERVERS. A remote server can have any number of upgrades installed in it, but only either one asset or one agenda can be installed in a remote server at any given time. All cards installed in a remote server are kept in a pile in the same orientation and location together. The order in which the cards are installed is open information, but the type of cards installed in the server should not be derivable from their orientation or location.
         1. The Corp starts the game with no remote servers. The Corp creates new remote servers by installing cards into or protecting them. There is no limit to the number of remote servers the Corp can have at any given time.
         1. Cards installed in separate remote servers are placed in a vertical orientation in a row extending away from the central servers to indicate the locations of the remote servers relative to other servers. The ice installed protecting each remote server are placed in a horizontal orientation in front of any cards in that server, outwards towards the Runner.
         1. Only one **region** card can be installed in a remote server at a time. See section 3 .6.5.
         1. A remote server exists as long as there is at least one card installed in or protecting it. A remote server can be made up of only ice protecting it, only cards installed in it, or a combination of both.
         1. During checkpoints, a remote server ceases to exist if there are no cards installed in it and no cards installed protecting it. If a server ceases to exist during a run against it, then the run ends after any currently open paid ability window closes. Unless the run has already been declared either successful or unsuccessful, it is neither. See rule 8.2.7.
