# Subtypes

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Cards may have one or more subtypes, which are written following the primary type. Subtypes are card descriptors that can be referenced by card abilities. Cards that share a subtype often share a distinct characteristic or ability.
         1. The subtypes **region, console**, and **icebreaker** have special rules, discussed in sections 3.6.5, 3.8.5, and 3.9.5 respectively. Other subtypes have no intrinsic rules meaning.

      1. In card text, subtypes are always referenced in bold text. If a word or phrase that is also a subtype appears in a card’s text but is not in bold text, that word or phrase does not reference the subtype.
      1. Some abilities reference cards by a lack of subtype, such as “non-**virus**”. These abilities can only affect cards that do not have the specified subtype, regardless of any other subtypes the cards do have.
      1. A card has all of its subtypes at all times, even while inactive, with the exception of facedown installed Runner cards. See s ection 8.4.
      1. Abilities can add or remove subtypes. The number of times a card has, gains, and loses each subtype is tracked as a running total, but the result is binary: if the total number of instances of the subtype exceeds the number of times it is removed, the card has that subtype. Otherwise, it does not.

*Example: The Runner plays Tinkering on a Wendigo hosting 1 advancement token. Wendigo has two instances of Code Gate, one printed and one from Tinkering, and has lost one instance of Code Gate from its own ability. Thus it is still a Code Gate.*

      1. If an effect requires a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose a single subtype that has been printed on at least one card. If a player is required to choose a subtype belonging to a specific card type, they must choose a subtype that has been printed on at least one card with that type.
      1. Below is a list of all subtypes.
