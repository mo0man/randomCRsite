# Host, Hosted, and Hosting

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Whenever a card or counter is **“**&#8202;placed#8202;**” or “loaded”** onto a card, a host relationship is created between those two objects. The object placed on top of a card is HOSTED on that card. The card onto which the other object is placed is the HOST.
      1. The state of being hosted is distinct, but not exclusive from, the state of being installed. If an ability instructs a player to host a card from an inactive state without reference to installing it, the hosted card remains inactive.

      1. A card or counter can only be hosted on a single card at any given time.

&nbsp;

      1. A card can host any number of other objects, except where explicitly restricted by a card ability.
      1. Any card can act as a host, but a host relationship can only be created or permitted by a card ability.
         1. If a card has an ability describing the types and/or numbers of cards it can host, but it does not have an ability that directly hosts cards onto itself, then the card is permitted as an eligible installation destination for the types of cards listed, up to the number specified. A host card is chosen as an installation destination during s tep

&#56; .3.2 of the installation process.

&nbsp;

*Example: Off-Campus Apartment has the ability, “Off-Campus Apartment can host any number of **connections**.” This means that whenever the Runner installs a **connection** card, they can choose to install that card into the play area hosted on Off-Campus Apartment or as normal directly into the play area.*

         1. If a card has an ability describing cards it can host, but also one or more abilities that can create host relationships onto itself, then it only allows cards to become hosted on it through those abilities. A card cannot be installed directly onto the card through an unrelated install effect.

*Example: Glenn Station reads, “Glenn Station can host a single card”, but also has a paid ability that hosts a card on itself. Therefore, Glenn Station only lets the Corp host cards through that paid ability, not through an install action.*

         1. If a card has an ability stipulating that it can only be installed hosted onto another card, then during the installation process a player that wishes to install that card must choose a valid destination matching the description provided. If no such destination exists before the installation process begins, the card cannot be installed.

*Example: Egret states, “Install Egret only on a rezzed piece of ice.” The Runner can only install Egret if there is an installed, rezzed piece of ice available before the installation process begins; otherwise, it is illegal for the Runner to install Egret.*

         1. Some operations and events convert themselves into condition counters and install themselves hosted onto other cards. An operation or event can never be installed through an install effect; it can only become an installed counter through its conversion ability. See rule 10.1.4.
      1. Unless otherwise noted, a card that is hosted as it is installed is hosted onto the destination card in the same faceup or facedown status it would normally be installed in.
      1. Once a card is installed, hosted or not, a player cannot change that card’s hosted status unless a card ability explicitly directs it to be hosted onto a new card.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. Host relationships are not transitive. If card A is hosted on card B, and card B is hosted on card C, card A is not considered to be hosted on card C.

*Example: If the Runner installs a Leprechaun hosted on a Dhegdheer, programs hosted on Leprechaun do not have their install costs reduced because they are hosted on Leprechaun and not on Dhegdheer.*

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. If an ability on a card refers to a “hosted” card or counter, that ability only references cards and counters hosted on that card.
      1. Hosted cards and counters can be removed or spent from their host without affecting the host.
      1. If a host card is uninstalled, all cards and counters hosted on that card (and all cards hosted on those cards, and so on) are trashed during the next checkpoint. This cannot be prevented. See section 10.3 for details on checkpoints.
