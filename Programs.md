# Programs

*Programs are digital tools at the Runner’s disposal, primarily used as a means of intrusion.*

      1. The Runner installs programs into the play area.

&nbsp;

      1. Programs are among the types of cards with install costs. The Runner installs a program faceup and active by paying its install cost. See section 8.2.
      1. Programs are the only card type that have a memory cost. A program’s memory cost is the number of memory units that program requires while it is installed.
         1. A program’s memory cost is not consumed. If a program becomes uninstalled, the memory units it required are available for other programs.
         1. When the Runner installs a program that would increase the total memory cost of installed programs over their memory limit, they must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of installed programs including the new program will not exceed their memory limit. See section 8.2.
         1. If the Runner’s memory limit decreases below the total memory cost of installed programs, or if the total memory cost of installed programs increases above the memory limit for any reason other than installing another program, the Runner must trash one or more installed programs such that the total memory cost of the remaining programs does not exceed their memory limit. This occurs during the next checkpoint after the memory limit is exceeded. See section 10.3.
         1. A program’s memory cost is not a cost. It cannot be increased, lowered, ignored, or otherwise modified by abilities that affect costs to install programs.
      1. Programs are among the card types that have strength.

         1. Programs with the subtype icebreaker have a printed numerical strength value. An icebreaker’s strength determines which ice it is allowed to interact with. See section 3 .9.5.

      1. &nbsp;
         1. Programs without the subtype **icebreaker** do not have a strength value. A dash (–) is printed on non-**icebreaker** program cards **in the place where strength is printed on icebreaker program cards**.
