# Appendix: Previous Revision

**Summary from 1.3**

* Slightly reworked the definitions of actions and action phases. A player can no longer take an action outside their action phase under any circumstances. In particular, if an effect would try to allow a player to take an action after a Terminal operation has resolved, nothing happens (rule 5.2.5 and section 5.4).
* Clarified how to distinguish actions for the purposes of determining whether they are “the same” or “different”, as referenced by Jeeves Model Bioroids and MirrorMorph: Endless Iteration (section 5.2.6).
* Clarified and expanded the Run Ends Phase and the procedure for resolving an “end the run” effect. In particular, version 1.2 of the Comprehensive Rules did not adequately specify what to do if an effect ends the run while a paid ability window or one or more reaction windows are open. The rules for the Run Ends Phase now explicitly state which priority windows are completed normally after an “end the run” instruction resolves, and which priority windows are closed without resolving any of their remaining pending abilities (section 6.1, section 6.8.2, and s tep 6.9.6a). Rule 6.5.5a and s ection 12.3 have also been updated to refer to these expanded rules as appropriate.
* Updated and clarified rules about successful and unsuccessful runs. “Successful” is now explicitly stated to be a label applied to a run, so that declaring a run to be successful is separate from the procedure for accessing cards. Added a definition for the corresponding “unsuccessful run” label, and expanded rules about when that label should or should not be applied. Issued clarifying errata to Crisium Grid, making use of these changes to simplify the card’s effect without changing its practical functionality (rule 6.7.2, section 6.8.4, step 6.9.5e, step 6.9.6c, and s ection 11.2.30).
* Corrected an error in rule 4.7.8f, where the rule about ending the run due to a server ceasing to exist had been written too generally.
