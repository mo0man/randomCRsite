      1. INSTALLING an agenda, asset, ice, upgrade, hardware, program, or resource card is the act of placing that card into the play area. Events and operations are never installed.
         1. Cards and counters can also be installed onto other cards if either the card being installed onto or the card or counter being installed has an ability allowing this. The relationship created this way is called HOSTING and is discussed in section 1.12. Some abilities also host cards without installing them.
         1. A card or counter is UNINSTALLED when it stops being installed for any reason.

      1. An agenda, asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is UNREZZED if it is installed and facedown. An asset, upgrade, or piece of ice is REZZED if it is installed and faceup. Runner cards, faceup agendas, operations, events, and counters are neither rezzed nor unrezzed.
         1. To REZ an unrezzed card is to turn it faceup. Normally this can only be done in an appropriate paid ability window, as discussed in section 9.2.7, and requires the Corp to pay the cardâ€™s rez cost. Cards can be rezzed at other times by effects, which may ignore the rez cost or require it to be paid.
         1. To DEREZ a rezzed card is to turn it facedown. Cards are only derezzed by card effects.
      1. PLAYING an event or operation is the act of placing that card into the play area. Agendas, assets, ice, upgrades, hardware, programs, and resources are never played.
