   1. Deck Construction
      1. Each player’s deck is associated with a single identity card that determines the faction, minimum deck size, and influence limit of that deck. The identity card may also stipulate other variances from the standard deckbuilding rules.
      1. Each deck must meet all requirements in this section to be legal for play.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. The deck must contain at least as many cards as the minimum deck size indicated on the corresponding identity.
         1. Identity cards, extra cards that begin the game outside the deck, and player aid cards are not part of the deck and are not counted towards the size of the deck.
         1. There is no maximum deck size.

&nbsp;

      1. Decks cannot contain identity cards, player aid cards, cards from the wrong side (Corp cards in a Runner deck or vice-versa), or out-of-faction cards that lack influence costs.
      1. Neutral cards and cards that belong to a faction other than the corresponding identity’s faction are all considered out-of-faction. The total influence cost of out-of-faction cards in the deck must not exceed the influence limit of that identity.
         1. The total influence cost of out-of-faction cards is counted by copy and not by name.

&nbsp;

*Example: Including a single copy of Diesel in a non-Shaper deck adds 2 to the total influence in that deck, while including two copies of Diesel in a non-Shaper deck adds 4 to the total influence in that deck.*

   1. &nbsp;
      1. A Corp deck must contain agendas totalling a certain number of agenda points, as determined by the total number of cards in the deck.
         1. A deck with 40 to 44 cards must contain 18 or 19 agenda points.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. A deck with 45 to 49 cards must contain 20 or 21 agenda points.

&nbsp;

   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. A deck with 50 to 54 cards must contain 22 or 23 agenda points.

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. &nbsp;
         1. A deck with more than 54 cards must contain 22 or 23 agenda points, plus an additional 2 agenda points for every full 5 cards in the deck over 50.

*Example: A 66 card deck requires 6 additional agenda points, since it includes 3 sets of 5 cards beyond 50. This gives a final requirement of either 28 or 29 agenda points.*

&nbsp;

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. The deck cannot contain more than 3 copies of any single card, by name. Some cards stipulate alternative copy limits in their card text.
      1. Tournament play may impose other restrictions or requirements on the legal configurations of identities and decks.
