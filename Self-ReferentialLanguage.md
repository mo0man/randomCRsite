# Self-Referential Language

1. &nbsp;
   1. &nbsp;
      1. If the card name referenced on a card matches the name of that card, and the reference is not plural and/or does not include an additional modifier (e.g., “other copies” or “all”), then the card name only refers to that copy of the card, and not to any other copies of it.
      1. If a card copies the text of another card, and the copied text includes a self-reference, the copied text does not function unless it explicitly says so.

*Example: The Runner uses Media Blitz to copy the text of a Private Security Force in the Runner’s score area. Because the self-reference in Private Security Force does not match the name of the card Media Blitz, the ability has no effect.*
