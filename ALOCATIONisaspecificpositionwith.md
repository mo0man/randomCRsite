         1. **A card in a playerâ€™s deck has a location identified by how many cards it is from the top of that deck.**
         1. **Corp cards in the play area are always installed in specific locations: Assets, agendas and upgrades must be located in a particular server or root, and ice must be located in a particular position protecting a particular server.**
         1. **The location of a hosted card or counter is its host card.**

         1. **All other cards, including non-hosted Runner cards in the play area, are simply located in their zone and do not have a more specific location.**
   1. Searching
      1. If a player is instructed to SEARCH a zone for one or more cards, they look at all the cards in that zone for cards matching the criteria of the search.
         1. If a player is instructed to search a hidden or secret zone, they are temporarily allowed to look at those cards until the search is complete, so long as they maintain that zone as hidden or secret as necessary to the other player.

      1. While a player is searching, they may FIND an appropriate number of cards matching any criteria of the search by taking them from the zone being searched and setting them aside facedown.
         1. A card cannot be found for a search unless it both matches the specified criteria of the search and can be acted upon by any other effects referencing the found card in the ability that initiated the search.

*Example: The Runner uses Artist Colony to search for a card and install it. They cannot find an event with the search because events can never be installed. They also cannot find a program, hardware, or resource that they cannot afford to install.*

         1. The searching player is not required to reveal any found cards unless instructed to do so by the ability that initiated the search. Found cards are not revealed until resolution of the ability that initiated the search resumes, pending any necessary shuffling.
         1. If a player is searching for a set number of cards without any specified criteria, they must find that many cards from that zone or all the cards in that zone if there are not enough.
         1. If a player is searching a deck for one or more cards with specified criteria, they may choose to fail to find anything, even if one or more cards matching the criteria exist in that deck.
