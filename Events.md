# Events

      1. Events are the only Runner cards that are played. Events are never installed. Playing an event causes its abilities to become active, and once those abilities are fully resolved the event is trashed. See section 8.5.
         1. One event (On the Lam) has the subtype **condition**. As part of its abilities, it converts itself into a condition counter and installs itself. This event cannot be installed by an install effect; it can only be installed through its own conversion ability. See rule 10.1.4.
         1. Some events have the subtype **current**. As part of their abilities, **current** events prevent themselves from being trashed until another **current** operation or event is played or the Corp scores an agenda. When one of these occurs, the active **current** is trashed during the next checkpoint. See section 10.3.
      1. Events are the only Runner cards with play costs. An eventâ€™s play cost is the number of credits the Runner must spend to play the event. See section 8.5.
