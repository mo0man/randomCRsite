# Actions

      1. An ACTION is any paid ability that includes one or more \[click\] in its cost.

      1. A player initiates an action by paying its cost in \[click\], as well as any other costs associated with that action, during their action window. The action is complete once all of its effects are fully resolved.
         1. Once an action is initiated, it must be completed before the game can advance to the next step or open another action window. If the effects of an action initiate a timing structure, such as a run, players may use paid abilities, rez cards, and score agendas as dictated by the priority windows of that nested timing structure, but otherwise players cannot perform any of those voluntary effects while the action is resolving. See S ection 9.2 for more details about priority.
         1. If a timing structure is initiated during the resolution of an action, that action is not complete until the new timing structure is complete and any further effects of the initiated action following the completion of the new timing structure are resolved.

*Example: The Runner takes the action “play an event”, playing Stimhack. The action is not complete until the run initiated by Stimhack ends, the Runner suffers brain damage and returns the unspent credits, and Stimhack is trashed following its resolution.*

      1. Each player has several basic actions they can always perform. The Corp’s basic actions are listed in section 5.2.6, and the Runner’s basic actions are listed in section 5.2.7.
      1. A player can only take an action if its effect has the potential to change the game state. See rule 1.2.5.
      1. A player can only take actions during the action phase of their turn. If an effect directs a player to take an action outside of that player’s action phase, instead that player does nothing.
      1. Some cards refer to players taking “the same action” or “different actions”.

         1. Actions a player performs are the same if they are all the same basic action or if all of those actions were initiated by the same ability from the same card.
         1. Actions a player performs are different if each of them is initiated from a different basic action or card ability. Instances of equivalent abilities on different cards are still different actions.

*Example: The Corp, playing MirrorMorph: Endless Iteration, plays Hedge Fund as the first action of their turn, then plays Lateral Growth. Even though two different cards were played, both times the Corp used the basic action to “Play 1 operation from HQ”. Since*

&nbsp;

*their first two actions were the same, the Corp will not be able to trigger the ability on MirrorMorph this turn.*
