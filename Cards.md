         1. Runner cards that are installed and faceup in the play area, Corp cards that are installed and rezzed, events and operations in the play area, agendas in the Corp’s score area, and both players’ identities are active.
         1. Unless otherwise stated, Runner cards are played and installed active into the play area.
         1. Unless otherwise stated, Corp cards other than operations are installed unrezzed, and thus inactive, into the play area. Assets, ice, and upgrades **are** made active by rezzing them; agendas are made active by scoring them. Operations are played active into the play area.
      1. Cards that are INACTIVE are unable to affect the game or have most of their abilities used.

         1. Cards are inactive in R\&D, HQ, Archives, the heap, the grip, the stack, the Runner’s score area, **while set aside,** and while removed from the game. Cards installed facedown are also inactive.
         1. Inactive cards in most zones retain their printed characteristics (name, card type, faction, cost, subtypes, influence, etc). Runner cards installed facedown have no characteristics.
