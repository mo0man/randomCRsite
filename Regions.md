per server.”

         1. The **region** limitation applies only to cards with the subtype **region** that are installed or in the process of being installed in a remote server or the root of a central server. It does not apply to cards in central servers, and it does not apply to ice.
         1. The **region** limitation applies to all cards as specified in rule 3.6.5b, regardless of the active or inactive state of those cards.
         1. When the Corp installs a card with the subtype **region** into a server that already has a **region**, they must trash the already installed **region**. See section 8.2.
         1. The Corp cannot swap a **region** card with a non-region card in another location if there is another **region** card already installed in the destination location.
