      1. The action phase is the first phase of the Runner’s turn and the second phase of the Corp’s turn. It is the only timing structure in which players can take actions, as discussed in section 5.2.
      1. During a player’s action phase, they must continue to take actions until they have no more clicks or the phase is ended directly by a card ability. The player may take actions in any combination and order as long as they pay the appropriate costs. Once they have no remaining clicks, the action phase ends.
      1. A player’s action phase can be forced to end by certain card abilities (e.g. via the ability on a **terminal** operation or event). When a player’s action phase is forced to end, the following occurs:
         1. The current step of the action phase ends, and all remaining steps are skipped.
